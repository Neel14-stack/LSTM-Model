the paper I get is I get soda Clues right as to what I'm supposed to do now and how I'm supposed to get get the other Clues to hold it down and come up with a final thing.It's been for ages now.Absolutely.I just now well, I've been up all week.Well this week I've been working really hard at it because before it's been going on longer than a week, right, but I've been working really hard on it for this week because you normally have another is the numbers you see right?It's the numbers you have to find out.Yeah, I have a small business with my sister selling Pottery.I am a

away and she told me to get the fuck away from her.Anyway, okay, so she did that.And so I said, yeah, I didn't think she was very clever enough, you know not end.Well, I went to see the doctor about it.Okay, cuz I thought I show her cuz she's a doctor, you know, she's been to University.She's done stuff.Yeah, they cash it.She didn't she said she didn't have time.I thought how you cannot have time to hear about the cure for world.Hunger all those starving children, you know what I mean?So that's why she sent me here to tell you to tell you all about it.Okay, right.Well, it's I've got my very special and pieces here.I find in the papers like, you know, the football results, right they need to adding together.Okay, and then I have found some other information on this page.There's some pages and page numbers.They're right add those together and take it away from what's on there.Right?So I do that and you find and you find you find other things.That number corresponds to numbers on my on my chart at home.I've got the big chart on my wall.Right and I find that number.Okay, and that adds up to something else, huh?It's it's all there.I mean that's that's that's really good.I'm going to get one of those.That's really good.That's that's a phone.It doesn't internet right and everything.So I'll be able to find out more stuff.You know that way when I'm out and about and so there's numbers you see all use those numbers there, right?You know, they'll be they'll need adding up.Okay and talking away from someone something.Yeah, and the chart.Yeah.what isWell, it's a cure for world hunger in it.That's what it is.the cure for world hungerwell how it works is God tells me you know that I'm real.I'm doing a really good job, right and how great I am and how fantastic it is.I'm working up this, you know, okay, and I just keep going at it.Okay, you know, I don't stop I don't stop at all.Yeah, sure.God tells me go on.Well, he he tells me you just talk to me.Yeah.Yes, he talks

of stuff to the pope right in the Archbishop of Canterbury and none of them have written back.You think they would you know.Yeah, well, I mean the pope he claims to have met him right?I mean you don't

germs and fear of intruders coming to attack my family.I feel that if I don't do certain things each day that bad things will happen.Yes, I would like to get your help because I can't seem to get through the day without these rituals taking so much time out of my life.They are getting worse.Yes, I feel the need to wash my hands constantly.I am afraid of getting germs from things that other people touch.I feel I need to wash them three times.Every time I touch something that someone else may have touched such as door knob light switch for a faucet handle.I usually use a paper towel to open things.So I don't have to touch anything directly if I touch something and I don't wash three times.Then I am afraid that I will get get germs that could cause me to get sick.I have fears that I forget to lock the door turn off the lights.So I will go and turn the Lock 3 times in the need to wash my hands three times.I find this happening so much that I am late for my job in the morning on my way to work.I have had to turn around and drive home to see if I remembered to turn off the coffee pot.This is embarrassing because I know what I am doing.I can't stop it.I'm afraid that I will get some bad germs that will get into my body.And if I don't lock the lock the door, then someone will come and attack me and my family if I don't check the doors in the windows and lock everything three times.I just feel that something bad will happen.Then I'm afraid that I forgot to lock the doors in the windows.So I'm repeatedly checking on them.Then.I must wash my hands three times because of germs.Probably 60 times.I have contact dermatitis on my hands because they are irritated from the constant washing.Yes, I changed after I come in from work or being out in public.I have separate laundry hampers for my clothes depending on where I wore them work is different than the grocery store.I check everything before I leave work when I come home from work and before bed and waking up in the morning if I checked three times, then it feels right.I feel relief if I check in town three times.I wake up anxious during the night and sometimes must check things in the house like the Windows Doors coffee pot and lights in the garage and closet.Then I try to go back to sleep and sometimes I lay awake for hours.So yes, my sleep is interrupted by the checking.I feel that I must do everything three times the washing counting and checking takes up so much time and I know it is not normal.I want to stop I want to feel normal again.I have always been particular about things but this is really taking over my life.I want to stop but if I don't do the county checking and washing then it doesn't feel right.I feel relief when I get these things.It's only temporary belief, but really really spot relief nonetheless.It's terrible.My husband is so understanding but worried and wants me to get help because it is disrupted in our house hold the kids wonder why must do everything three times and why can't touch the certain things in the house because of the fear of germs.I don't want them to learn these things for me.I work in his account as an egg and accounting.So I have to I have my own office and don't have to interact a lot with the Republic.I just wipe my phone down with bleach wipes.Every time I come into my office.I also wiped the doorknob or avoid it.I don't know if anyone at work that was the extent of my compulsions.I think my secretary knows because she has worked.For me in the past 10 years since I started.We have three kids.The oldest is eight the middle of 6 and the youngest is for the full 4 year old is just starting to mimic how I use a paper towel to open things.I don't want this to affect them.I don't want them to get work get what I have.Are you because I can't resist in the feeling that something bad will happen just overwhelms me.I take a multivitamin and Tylenol or Advil for headaches, which isn't often.I drank a bit in college never smoked.I'm 36 and I was about 12 or 13 one of these things started for sure.I started to really avoid anything that I that had contact with others hands mainly always worried about being attacked or mugged by some criminal.I have always been a clean and neat person from childhood.My mother was a very neat and kept person.She was very particular about how she kept the house and her personal appearance.My dad was a Salesman and was well kept but not more than other people.I guess my siblings are brother and sister are messier than I am.Most definitely.No, no physical or sexual abuse at all.Well, my mother died right after we were married about 11 years ago or maybe 10 it was right before I started my position with the accounting firm.My father passed just before we were married while I was still in college.My siblings are both living and healthy.Well, yes it did.No, it was just after her funeral.That's when I felt the need to count and wash more often.I felt so low.I wanted to die right after my mother passed.I was depressed and felt so low, but I didn't attempt suicide.I don't have ideas of some home on the side quite the opposite.I'm worried about keeping my family safe.I'm worried about being attacked.No, I just recently went to doctor green because this is becoming too much.Yes.Will help me stop this and be able to have my life back.Oh June sign.Well, it's the same thing that I've seen Doctor Jones about it's my heart.No, not at all.It's just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really really race.Like boom.Boom, right I get chest pain.I can't catch my breath.It's making me feel feel funny talking to you about it.Right and so my heart starts to race.I can't get my breath and then I get chest pains and I get very afraid.I'm going to have a heart attack.I am okay.Yeah, just talking about it.I can feel it starting to come up.Yeah, that's exactly it.I think it's probably about six months.Basically.Yeah.Well, I think we've had some problems at work.I've felt more stress about work than I normally do and basically I was just trying to get into town one day on a off day and it was very hot.One of those funny hot days.It just happened my heart started to race and race and race and I couldn't get my couldn't get my breath.I was just like gasping for breath.Then I started to get chest pains and it was just awful and I'm managed to sit down and call my husband and he came out.He actually left work to come and get me.It was awful it really it was really really frightening.I thought I was having a heart attack.I am only 25.I really did.Yeah, and each time.It happens.I'm so afraid that that it is that is what's happening.So, you know, I started to try and avoid situations where I might get like that basically.I can't get into town now without my husband taking me cuz because my husband has to take me to and from work and I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all.So I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment and other things as well.Well, just some personal things.Yeah, right.I just feel that I shouldn't, you know do anything like that because it might put too much strain on me.Yeah, yeah.It's not I mean, yeah, my husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest doctor.He's been really really kind and really supportive but I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot.Now you wanted me to go to the pub last week and I absolutely promise that I would because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's going to happen and I promised and promised him I go to the tub and then know when it came to to it, I just couldn't I just sat on the sofa and it started happening to to happen again, right?And then I was worried if I went to the pub I'd actually get it'll in the pub and then it'd be really embarrassing for everyone.So I justSaid I couldn't go and I think he's getting a bit to the end of his tether now because it just seems to have come out of the blue and I've never suffered from anything like this before.Yeah, I am actually yeah, yeah.No, not at all.I mean, I think we had a new manager at work.I work in a bank actually and then we had a new computer system put in so it became much more stress stressful for all the staff not just me and I can sort of see you.I was under a lot of pressure right that could be affecting me.Yeah.Yeah, yeah.I don't know.No, I don't want to risk it to be honest.No, no.It is a bit.Yeah.Yeah, yeah.Well, I was told that it was okay and there was no problems and you know, I did feel relief, you know, because obviously there has been heart attacks in my family.My dad died of one, you know, I 72 so I'm thinking of must be my heart.There must be something wrong with it.Right and I did feel pleased with the doctor said that but on the other hand nothing's changed, you know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems right?Nothing.You know, I'm not getting any help with it.I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the symptoms and they're getting worse and worse.I do.I just can't understand it.What do you think?It is Doctor?I think I've been thinking more recently.It could be because my friend has panic attacks and I've discussed it with her and she said to be honest.It just sounds like that.I've always thought it was my heart and what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing likeNot really.No.Yes, I have heard of that.I do I do.Yeah, I do remember that.I think like if you're in a scary situation you either fight or run away, basically.yeah, definitely.Definitely all those actuallyOh, absolutely.I've started to really monitor monitor my heart and when it starts to race I start to get worried and then it starts getting faster and faster.So it does feel.Yeah, definitely.Yeah.I really do start wearing.Yes.So I keep thinking it is going to be now, you know, you know is my heart going to stop breathing.Yeah, yeah.It does make sense doctor.I have ya like not walking to town or anything.I just won't do it anymore.Right.Yeah, right.It does it does make sense.Alright, okay.Oh, that's fine.That's fine.No, I'll make an appointment to see you next week.Okay.Thank you doctor.I know it's not time to symbolize depression yet, but I think I have what would be depression if it were happening consistently for 2 weeks.I'm feeling like a water time.I'm having unsettled thoughts more like wanting to hurt myself non-fatally thoughts.Really easily like overacting to something small going wrong.Yeah, irritable anxious a lot of the anxious anxiety uncomfortable feeling.I'm notI'm not crying non-stop.So I don't know.It's like when I had depression and I knew it was depression sophomore year.I was crying Non-Stop and it was this big feeling like sort of a cloud over me, but it was more of a physical feeling it.Was there pretty much the entire time.That's not really there.Most of today yesterday mid-afternoon, so I didn't wake up until 12 p.m. Or something.So I hadn't been awake for that long.10 hours or something.I think we were up pretty late.We were up until 2 or something.I also felt it last week Sunday and Monday and Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday.I was okay.I sing a little bit mad at work, but it wasn't such a big deal that I needed to leave earlier anything.It was just getting things done.That's what that was.The only one of the two days though.I think maybe that was actually the week before I think it was mostly okay at work last week.I know depression is more consistent than that.I'm not really sure what to do.I'm not sure because it usually starts mid-to-late day.Saturday was fine.I even went out walking for a good two and a half hours.Saturday was a good day.There's nothing bad that happened yesterday that triggered it.Yeah, maybe it was more in the evening.I wasn't I wasn't very good at things like sitting made dinner.I couldn't even go to the grocery store and get ingredients for dinner, which is something that I would normally be able to do.Lots of anxiety, I guess I could ask as a physically made myself.True.It wasn't really able sargi.I wasn't feeling well sarjak.I was just feeling sad and anxious.Maybe it was sadness and anxiety.It's really hard for me to be clear on that on even though it was a day ago.I should really I should remember it really well.I'm also things that I need to take note of in general.I think my brain functionalities talked right now.I don't know if I'm actually getting stupid or something, but I'm a little bit slower not remembering things not remembering all the things but I'm a little bit slower and not remembering all the things.I think little things like I know it came up yesterday or the day before and now I can't even remember what the example was, but it wasn't something normally I would have caught and didn'tThat is not happened.I'm so good at scheduling all the things.No worse than usual.It's easy to lose things at Sydney's place.But oh, I think I know what it was.I was trying to figure out moving.So I had on Friday finally called the movers Peter and Barbara recommended and they said the stuff for September 1st looks up and by the beginning of August, but it still mid-july.They were actually booked through the days before in the days after and they gave me two other companies that was around lunchtime on Friday.And I forgot about calling them.I was in the middle of dyeing wool.My purse is upstairs in my hands are covered with dye.So I didn't have the numbers then by the time I was done with that.It was after business hours.So I had to wait until today there was that was something I normally would have been able to remember and would have done it.Yeah, then I wasn't even feeling sad I had to die.I had to die one thing but then I decided to die for scanes of yarn while I was at it.That was even when I started feeling good things that I normally wouldn't forget.Mostly just me and then comfortable feeling my brain telling me that if I physically hurt myself it would feel better.Sometimes it might be flashes of cutting myself.But in reality, I have a weird sweetness about cutting skin, so I wouldn't do that.I think it's more of a you need to hurt yourself in order to feel better.Nothing more than briefly digging my fingernails into my skin.Not even though even not even enough to puncture.That was a long time ago.Nothing that would actually hurt myself a little bit more than temporarily.Eventually, it just goes away at the same time that the anxious uncomfortable feeling goes away.Then I no longer feel like I have to hurt myself.I have the 85 mg ofDoes superior mean and my birth control pill vitamin D vitamin B complex and that's only in the morning in the evening.It's the 75 mg of Seroquel and 25 whatever.It is milligrams of Klonopin.It doesn't really occur to me, I guess because of specially when it happens at night and I've taken my night time meds.I'm like, okay, I just took the Klonopin if it's not working.I don't think a second one wouldit's okay for me to use it during the day or something.The thing is a prescription is worded such that I can take it that I can take another one heard a part of me thinks it will interfere with my morning driving and come here.It used to when I took it eventually I would get used to it.But the whole getting used to it.Seems like it would be too much of a hassle for not that much reward.I don't actually know if it would make me feel better during the day to take a Klonopin.I don't even know if a Klonopin is working at all.I can go back to Xanax, but it seems like she's not much of a fan of that.Especially if I'm going to be any up taking it every day or something Klonopins unless it is less addictive.You know, that is something more regular to make things not as bad in the first place.Maybe it is working as well as it can is just not enough time seeing her Friday.Yes.I just don't know what to do.I think nothing is really helping and I've gotten to the point that I'm not sure anything else.Would I also found out that it turns out that October ish of one of the Jenner generic producers of Wellbutrin produce some bad batches that was right around the time that I was having trouble with the Wellbutrin.I don't know.I don't think if it's enough to know whether that would be worth it to go back on Wellbutrin, especially because the disputer mean works with panic stuff in the Wellbutrin doesn't I think the welder chain was before then two then again, I usually like taking the generic one.I don't really have my old pill bottles so that I could go on then.Yeah, I don't know if the pharmacy.Because that would be a lot of information to hold on to 4.It's entirely possible that the Wellbutrin wasn't working because it was manufactured in correctly and not because it was an effect of my body.So I don't really know.I just thought I've just gotten to the point that if I'm medicated and still feeling depressed and there's nothing I can do there very few options left to me because we tried the mood stabilizer and that gave me weird side effects to it really seems like Wellbutrin and disappear mean are the two drugs that are for depression and have absolutely no serotonin side effects, unless you get to the crazy stuff like the maois those are kind of scary and they're kind of clunky and I don't know if they'd work any better than despair mean.I know that I go crazier when I'm off my birth control and not as upset and anxious as I would be if I were taking the placebo pills for a week.It must be doing something because I feel anxiety.I think my OCD would be a lot worse.If I wasn't on Seroquel, it's usually there a lot of stuff that that I talked about a long time ago, like the checking after flushing toilet usually doesn't happen so much anymore.Yeah, maybe because I'm not feeling depressed every single day.My antidepressants are working to some degree because maybe if I were off them, I don't know if I was on the end of them if I would completely beside all the time or if it's just that my depression only shows up some of the time and they're not doing anything.It would be a really bad idea to just go off something off of everything.Just the fact that I came up being sad for no reason and it's breaking through means that my drugs aren't working enough if I'm having these bad feelings for not being triggered by any certain thing.Yeah, but Saturday in usual though.Yeah, usually my Baseline would be if I'm sad there's no reason for it.There's a reason for it.Maybe you could should still could be the stress now.We're finally staying over at my place more so thatYes, Susan got mad at Sydney for having me over so much.I sent him an email and he kept on telling me it was okay.So I got really mad at him for that.That he would let it get that far.Therefore.It was insensitive for him to have us actually spend more time in my place.It's okay.I got the AC in the room.So now it's livable again.It's a little bit annoying in terms of having food that I actually like to eat around and we still haven't made a trip to the Hamden.But if we go out to eat meat to eat for meals and stuff, then it's not such a big deal.My room is chaotic, but it's not as chaotic as before.So it's like I can sleep in it without it being an issue.Then I get to do all my errands stuff that I need to get done.We were there last week Wednesday night Thursday Friday during the day and then one day his place you're going to come back on Saturday night, but I didn't but it didn't happen and neither did Sunday, but I think that will do this.I think what we'll do is spend Thursday night Saturday night and Sunday night over at my place on a regular basis.That way I don't have to keep food for work in two places.We're over at my place a fair bit.Also Susan after she said that she's on vacation until the 14th.So she's not even around right now.Because he kept on telling me it's okay.It's okay Susan something angry email to Sydney, but I feel like she was also mad at me and I wanted to not have this happen the first place the fact that he kept on telling me nobody Minds.I sort of feel I felt sort of betrayed by that.I wish you had done more thinking and actually had talked to people to see whether that was a problem rather than just a shirring me that it wasn't a problem when it actually wasn't problem.She was all like they understand I'm depressed and that's why you're around a lot.I was like, yeah, but you had the conversation back in January.That was a long time ago.He thought it was fine.A lot but I don't think it would be the reason that I'm depressed after that all happened.He did say at my place for a few days that could have been why I was depressed on Sunday and Monday, but that's not why I'm depressed now.I also found out more stuff about my job.It turns out that the grant goes until December.I guess it's flexible enough so that it's not like if I do end up finishing everything really early they can find other things for me to do and I can stay until December talking to people on the internet.They think I should start my job search now,And I guess somehow mention in the cover letter that I'm working this grant right now.I'm not sure if I should tell them that we'll be done in December or if I will be done in September October which is when I would finish all the work at that I was hurt you.I feel like I should be applying for jobs again, but then I felt depressed again yesterday and today so I haven't I looked at one of the job sites in a lot of things that I found were going to work one that sounded really good was a temporary summer summer position and I don't think I could take.That time off from work and then go, you know things like that that wanted starting now and I was vastly under-qualified for the one that's on a really cool except that it was in Newport.And that was a 3 hour each way commute and I was like nah, I'm not doing that.I can't do worse commute that I'm currently doing.I will go crazy.I'm not getting on Newport.That was the only that was only one job site.It's the one that has the most jobs on it.I guess I'll go back to the right 3 cover letters and applications are weak if I can plan.I don't want to leave them way before I think I'm not sure if they expected me to stay until December or they expected me to stay until I finish the work and could stay on longer in those find more work for me, I guess because I'm not quite sure how to have that conversation.A little I'm not sure if any of the people at the library in the museum.know any institution Center closer to me that might be looking I feel like if they they reallydid that then it would be a good way to go because everybody in the museum thinks that my work is really good.They're all the way out in not that it would help but I've worked with an awesome archive.The archive was the only one who did all the digitization for them for free in return for being able to keep a digital copy of everything they digitized but that would mean more steps because of the archive in order to work there.He has to be in our arrested in I'm not making another move to all right, that's just not happening.I don't think I've ever seen a physician at the archive that didn't have a residency requirement.It's really frustrating because I see jobs from them and I'm like, that's a cool job 08 residency requirement.Yes, you have to live in RI proper.The people who live in or I can apply for all the jobs in New Haven and Wallingford and stuff but people who live in New Haven and Wallingford can't apply for RI.They be innocently rejected unless our cover letter had something that they could move to.All right for the job.I wonder if having a PO Box in RI would be except that would be a PO box and they know that so I don't think I have any friends who live in our a proper who could pretend to be living withI feel like that's the kind of thing that with taxes and Social Security if you do they be able to find out.No, I'm just sort of like I think I can do my current job with a depressed amount.I feel as long as I can get myself in the car and drive to work and drive back.If I start working slowly and me and said I'll be working at probably the level that they expected me to work in in the first place.So that's okay.I'm not sure about applying to other I guess I have to wait for days.Then I'm not feeling depressed to do the applications holding out something full time now seems scary.No, I really didn't.I don't know.I can't go back to being unemployed.I need to have something right away.I don't know my parents will.Yeah.It will only support me on certain conditions with stuff which would be really annoying.I don't know because it wasn't like I was thinking about any of those things when I was feeling sad.Because it was happening before I found that advice to I think that I think I got that advice over the last couple days.I think I had the conversation at work this past week which would mean that the depression that I felt on Sunday Monday was before I got that advice.I didn't ask for the advice until I had the conversation.I don't think it's just that I think I can handle even though I should be starting now.I feel like if I wait until I'm at least packed up for the move if I wait until I move it will be less bad because I can devote two weeks.2 days a week or two it or something.Maybe I guess I'm just thinking that it's brain chemistry in the drugs aren't fixing the brain chemistry.Even if I didn't have it be stressors.I might be feeling just as bad and it's just my brain not working and there's nothing I can do about my brain chemistry.I feel like the only way to control pain chemistry is thermae meds.I don't know how much trying to think differently would change that.Because when I do feel a depression, it's not usually from thinking about any of those dressers is just out of nowhere.Nothing that I can think of is actually triggering it.Maybe there are times when I got more upset like when I got upset with Sydney on Wednesday night about the now you tell me that your housemates don't want me around as much.I'm instead of listening to me months ago, but I was definitely a reacting to the normal amount of I shouldn't have been reacting as strongly as I did as I have and I thinkIs it been in a better place?I would have been reacting as strongly as I did those are triggered, but the rest of it comes from seemingly nowhere.Yeah, that's the part that makes me think his brain chemistry and I guess because I'm thinking if it were or just life stressors that it wouldn't be nearly then I wouldn't be nearly as upset as I am.Yeah, and I shouldn't be feeling like wanting to hurt myself for wanting to kill myself for many of those things normal people have job searches and moving and all of those things and don't feel suicidal.They might be sad or overwhelmed, but they're not going to the point of wanting to kill themselves because it would make everything else easier.Yeah.Yeah, especially since I found a place so that I'm not even worrying about that.There's a little bit of moved a parts that are stressing me because I've tried two companies and one was going to be for September 1st at 2:48 an hour.With a 6-hour minimum, which was going to be over $1,000.I'm pretty sure that my move can be done in 3 to 4 hours the company that I did end up going with I tentatively scheduled for August 30th, which I can cancel up to six days before I know then whether or not I can move in a little early because my new housemate mention that it's a possibility, but he's not sure.If not, I haven't asked yet.I tried to call him but he's not answering whether or not I could stay an extra day to see if I could get a September 2nd move and if they were open then I don't know if he actually has people coming in or if they're coming in on that day.So there's a little bit of stress there, but that didn't even come up until today and that wouldn't have affected things yesterday and not for that long.I guess if worse comes to worse, I could just rent a truck and have friend stay with me.It would just suck a lot.So I'd rather avoid that if possible.I look at my stuff and I'm like maybe I don't actually have that much.I need to pack.It's not very well organized.I think it's my brain chemistry, but it seems like the only logical explanation.That's the only thing that would be possible for me to be this out of proportion upset to things that are stressing me out.Yeah, maybe I could take a little more Klonopin, but I don't think it's going to be enough to have any lasting effect.Dr. Barnes when I asked her before she doesn't really think I could go up more on the despair mean and that she didn't think that going up would actually help it's really hard.When I feeling is Miss World to want to go out and exercise and do stuff.I've been having the sun lamp and using it especially because Sydney and gotten me a little mini orchid plant because I had seen them in the grocery store and thought they were so cool.You'd gone grocery shopping a few days later.So the mini Orchid because of that.It's like it needs to have partial sunlight and we have in the middle of the room and not in the window.So we use a sun lamp.I also have it when I'm dying wool.So that ends up being at least sunlight.I haven't actually gotten around to looking into it there some sort of sun lamp type thing that I could expose myself to while driving that wouldn't hurt my driving ability.No, but it's just like I'm I feel miserable sometimes when I'm driving and maybe that would make me feel less miserable.trueplus it's a rainy day.It's just really hard when I get to the point of wanting to hurt myself.It's not hard to prevent myself from hurting myself, but it's hard toYeah, and I don't really know what to do when I get back bad as soon as all like you need to fight those feelings.I can't just be there like the one to argue against you.He will he be like know everything is going to be okay.You don't need to kill yourself.Not really.I told him that he doesn't have to argue against me.He wants some sign that I'm fighting it in later after the conversation.I realize at the sidelines of that is that I'm not actually hurting myself and doesn't that count for something.Yeah, but he still does it anyway.I don't know.I'm not sure what he could say.If he could just give me hugs instead of telling me things like it's going to be better.I told him before if you tell me it's going to be okay.I'm going to argue against you because you're saying something without proof.Can you stop saying that?That sounds like it would work.Yeah, I don't know if he'd been be okay with me so crying, but that would at least be better.I just figured it would probably be impossible anyway.That would probably help.I told him so many times if you say that that's not actually going to make me feel better.Can you stop saying that?Yeah specially because it's going to be okay something that works on him.Yeah, I think it should work.Hopefully I won't be at a point that I need to use that but I'll probably will considering that today that even today.I'm justThat's true.best roomthere have been a couple times where I've been like maybe I do need to go to the ER but I've never gotten to the point where I've actuallyyeah.Do we have the rest of July schedule?The 22nd.Do you have a Friday that week or the week before?I guess I'll do the 19th.So it's right out.Let's see what your 30, let me put this in my calendar.Okay, 2:30 on the 19th.Okay.Those are both saved in my calendar.Okay.healerSleeping well, I should say I don't want to sleep sleep brings Night Nurse with it and I have the same nightmare over and over.I was wondering if I could get something to help me sleep and forget past events.Yes, I would like to get your help because I feel like I can't live my life.I'm not wanting to be around groups of people.I feel irritable and have been having trouble trouble concentrating and remembering things.I don't have an appetite and feel nauseated a lot lately.I'm 28 years old and feel like an old lady.Really?I have had nightmares for years throughout my childhood.And now I'm 28 and still having them and never like sleep and try to avoid it and need only about 5 hours a night so anxious and irritable feelings have increased more in the last few months, I guess.I noticed my nausea and loss of appetite since the separation from my husband and since moving into my grandparents his house again.Well, I have just moved back to town this last year with me two young daughters.I'm living at my grandparents house.They have both passed.I noticed after I move and that I don't feel settled and I have the symptoms.I just spoke ofI believe this all began with a panic attack I thought I was having a heart issues but realize that I was having a panic attack I just figured it was due to the split with my husband and moving back to my hometown and into the old houseI smoked cigarettes a pack a day started when I quit alcoholI went through treatment for my drinking and have been sober for eight years.No drug used.Otherwise.I love my grandparents as a child.I love this house except for the basement.I used to have to play with my cousin the basement.He was not a nice person five years older than me and likes to teach me all sorts of things sexual things.I was only five at the time and didn't understand.I felt dirty and ashamed I didn't tell anyone until I was an adult.I've gone to counseling for this as an adult.No one else knows.No, no way.I told the counselor once I can't tell them because it would all because all it would do is cause pain for the family.It's over and done and I just want to move on with my life.I have just separated from my husband and want to move on with my life.My mom was depressed and has issues.She's never been treated.My dad is fine.No problems.No other medical issues that I know of.Yes, emotionally and mentally not always but we just couldn't seem to work things out.I grew up with my step dad abusing my mom.So I recognize the cycle and I didn't want to get to the physical abuse stage.Just my cousin.My mom was pretty physical.She would get beat then ask kids would get beat.It was just messed up.I am on my own now and away from all of that.No way.I make sure that they are not left with anyone other than my sister and my grandmother when she was alive.They don't have sleepovers and they know about Good and Bad Touch.What is 5 + 1 is 7 they are good girls.Probably they are so small and innocent.I can't go there.My mom was a yeller and through things she cursed a lot and was not a happy person.She had me when she was 16.So we always kind of clashed.My husband was also a yeller and controller he means to protect me, but it goes too far.No medications and just basically talks about things that have happened in the past.Sometimes I feel stuck and need to talk to my counselor if that makes sense.I feel that I have less patience with my daughters and I also feel that I space out more having a hard time concentrating and sticking with tasks.I find myself wanting to go drive with the girls, you know, just get in the car and drive.It just feels confining in the house all the time, but I don't want to be around Bunches of people.I have always been mildly more sad than usual.I guess lately.I feel like I am suffocating and like I need space.I want to be alone.No suicide was a thought as I was growing up, but I can't leave my girls when my parents divorced.I wanted to die and later when they both remarried.I've talked to my counselor about that to the suicide stuff.I used to when I was a teenager, I would take a bunch of pills or just get into my mom's car and turn it on and go to sleep in the close-up garage.That was when I was in junior high and high school.I couldn't leave my girls though.We're so in my grandparents house.I had the panic attack and I don't feel entirely safe in the house.I just figured I was not used to living on my own.I'm scared of something happening to my daughters and I will not be able to protect them.I wake up from my nightmares and feel and over and overwhelming sense that I can't protect them.I go check on them after my heart slows and my shaking quits from The Nightmare.They are mostly the same.Someone is in the house chasing me and I need to save my family before he gets to them and kills us all they are dark dreams don't share with anyone outside of counseling.I learned my dreams were not normal dreams when I was growing up.My friends would look petrified as I told them about the killing chasing and fear.I wake up in a sweat out of breath and my heart racing.I done must get up and sit for a bit so I don't go back into the same dream.No, not to bring on very bad dreams some of the worst.I avoid napping.I also work at an insurance office and don't have time to sleep more than I do.I worry about my daughter's being harmed.Like I was I also worried about how the separation with my husband will affect them.But my parents divorced it was devastating to me.My life just went downhill.My Mom married an alcoholic that beat her and then she beat us the cops were at our house a lot to break up the fighting.It was embarrassing.We didn't eat well or often and I usually cooked for my sister and brother because my mom and stepdad were at the bar.We ate a lot of Pancakes.It was all I knew how to cook at 9 years old in the batteries cheap.I missed my dad.He never raised his voice or hit me one.He was the opposite of my stepdad.We moved every year.I was in school sometimes across the street or sometimes across town.I got behind in school because of changing so many times and I learned to not get too close to friends.No.No.Yes, when soldiers come home and have a hard time adapting back into normal life, right?I am interested.I need to not feel so scared and worn out what types of treatment do I have to get my mom or dad involved because I don't want to do that, you know.Yes, I will try.I was wondering if today was going to be the day that.What's that?Yeah.Good morning.So Micah gave me a prescription for Adderall.Wedge when I went to pick up they were out of and they were like, why don't you go to CVS and the other square and I'm at the one in this Square.I was like, well, when are you going to get adderal in?This is Friday, I guess maybe Saturday.I don't know.And they said Tuesday because the pharmacist had to order it yesterday and then it would come in today after 8 p.m.I'm like, well, I'm not going to take it until Monday anyway, so what's an extra day so I haven't started it yet.Will probably start tomorrow.It was a series of questions a lot of questions.Aveeno mild moderate or severe or none at all, you know.And you know the hyperactivity none of that stuff registered but most everything else did.I was kind of surprised that certain things that you know, I thought was me being organized that this test seems to suggest as a potential.Like coming home and putting my wallet and my keys in the same spot every time so I don't lose them things like that.And at the office if I don't put things in the spot if they're supposed to be I can't find them so you skip pissed off at Jess because she would lose her keys.And I would always be like, well, I never lose my keys.I never lose my wallet.I know exactly where they are.I come home and put them in the exact same spot every time you know.So that was a little strange to me.I mean, I guess if that's the only thing you do you don't have it.But with everything else I seem to be scoring.I don't remember a lot of the questions, but they were all I mean you would probably know what they are.Well, I told Jess and she was like well I suspected it.Yeah.Well, she thinks that yet has ADHD and she's meeting with whoever it is tomorrow.Yeah.I forgot the name or title something.I've got it here in a text developmental pediatrician.Way to poo poo on her parade.She's had this appointment for 6 months.What is a developmental pediatrician?See when I want to cover my ass.I tell people they've got to talk to a lawyer and you're doing the same thing.You're like, oh they need some Mental Health.Not to be analyzing you.Yeah, you do.Well, yeah.But I don't have a stake a lot of times but it's just more of a it's not an actual cover-your-ass.It's justpeople are like, oh I've got this problem.And if it's something I don't deal with I'm like you should talk to a lawyer.Yeah, it never hurts.Well, I imagine it's not a regular pediatrician who is in there for cold and flu and swallowing magnets.I don't know who referred it might have been her own therapist or whatever.She's worried.He's got you know, his cubby is a mess.He's got food and he leave stuff there.You leave stuff.Well, the thing is, I don't think that Jess is going to go down the route of having Ian taking medication that whatever alternative.It's a prisoner calling for Jess collect of the work number has been disconnected from the service.So in order for me to take the collect call I have to go on and talk to an operator and give them a credit card to pay for the call.It's times like this when they call like I can't stop and okay.Here's my credit card.Just just needs to get her stupid clients to call the right number, you know, I tell her about it, but I'm sure she forgets that she's got it, you know.Well, there's a 6-month wait to see this person.So they're clearly a specialist, you know.Well, maybe whoever is referring it thinks it might be something else as well.I'm sure tomorrow that's when the pediatrician recognizes that Jess is completely overwhelmed and just can't handle you know.You know, I don't see it.I mean, I'm sure when Lucille is around he acts differently clearly whatever she has he wants whatever he has she wants.He's fighting for my attention when she's playing with me.When I have him over he's downstairs playing with and wants to watch America's Funniest Home Videos.You know, can we download bad piggies?No, can we download bad piggies?No.Okay.We'll download Bad Piggies.I don't know.I had a title exam due yesterday that I kind of blew off.I was wondering if I had had the medication if I would have done it or not.I was in the office doing it and there was a bizarre Missing Link in the chain of title.It was a lot of different Lots coming from a lot of different ways.I had six of them.It dawned on me that is missing link that they didn't put it in the title reference, but it had to have been through probate.It's like 2:30 in the Probate Court closes at 4:30.I had Siri look up on my way flying down.I pull up the index and sure enough the guy who had the property died with a will and all I need to confirm is this one person was the sole heir of the will or the person in the will to get the property but it's in storage.The file is in storage is starting to put everything in storage now which fucks me because these are typically the late sixties and seventies are when I need probate and older ones.They order on Fridays, but they're not going to order it until Friday and I'm not going to have it until Tuesday.And the title was due yesterday.So I left the registry and said I'll just finish the title and explain that I need to follow up on this a week from now.So for some reason I decided to go get Chinese food whenever I get Chinese food I get way too much and I hate it all.I basically just fell asleep on the couch and never got out and finish the title even waking up at 11 and was up for several hours.I just blew it off.And I'm not really even anxious or stressed out about it.Really what was interesting is that Sunday morning was one of those days I get anxious aboutI had to take Ian to snowboarding.Right.Well as we're driving out there I could just hear Injustice voice when Ian called her that she didn't sound good.She's like I'm throwing up.I've been throwing up.And I'm like, oh shit because the last time the week before I got in at about 11 and we had stopped at Dunkin Donuts and we didn't hustle to get out of there.So it probably would have been fine.Actually the first thing that kind of came and at first I was like fuck but then I was like it is what it is.And you know, if I'm a few minutes late then I'm a few minutes late.I get out to the slopes and Jess's mom agrees because they live right there.So she's going to meet me and she chose a different gas station right where she would turn on to the route.But then just was so sick that she needed her mom because Jess was going out to her parents.And that's what made it easy to meet, you know.Yeah.But just needed her mom to come in and so she was going to come in, but she was going to do it with Ian.So she went in and her dad ended up picking up the in.They're all works out.Just the whole thing.There was no anxiety no stress, you know.I don't know.I have tickets to a rock concert Sunday night.When the AFC Championship my buddy can't find anyone to go.So I'm stuck with $120 worth of tickets.130 hundred $40 worth of tickets, you know what they show you where the buyer alerts are on StubHub.Well, first of all, there's been no sales this year.There's only like 6 7 8 tickets available.But there are all these people with alerts at $100.So I put $99 so we'll see if someone buys it today tomorrow is the last day, but I knew that was going to be my problem selling the ticket when people want to watch the game.You know, it's a 6:30 game.So, you know, it's the same Rock concert and the football have the same fan base, you know.No, I mean I've already spent the money.I'm kind of getting used to getting screwed over.But I just you know, same thing as last Friday, I'm not as anxious.Kind of been thinking about you know, yeah, if I really do have ADD how much different my life would have been if this had been discovered, you know, 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago 5 years ago two years ago a year ago 6 months ago, you know.Yeah, so that was kind of bothering me a bit.Really, you know Michael was kind of explaining to me how it's difficult sometimes like it's kind of you know, that's why I even her talking to me.I think it was her.It was more just hey, let's try more than really she just saw the low motivation.He fixes things with drugs.That's what she does.I mean, you've got a history of not picking things up.the depressionno, it was a marriage counselor that took me through the checklist.You didn't bring it up.Yeah, I know.Yeah, I know.I'm just giving you shit.So yeah.I know it's one of those things and it's come up and I think we even talked about it before.I think we've talked about it because it came up at the hospital or somewhere else that came up.I'm actually it never even crossed my mind that you would have been the person so I never even thought about that.I just thought more the large or abstract.You know, it's one of those if I knew then what I know now.But I didn't really, you know spend too much time on that.It just popped in my head few times.I'm wondering when I'm going to get extremely sick because I mean I did have that morning of diarrhea, but I'm wondering if that was it or if I've got something to come because I was around them on Saturday.Yeah, she kept the kids home yesterday.I still haven't done my laundry.Maybe I'll do it today.I've got to do my laundry.I'm supposed to pick up Ian today, but Jess is going to pick him up.So I have my afternoon to go do all of that.Yeah, I got to stop eating Chinese food.When I went to get the Chinese food, they've got a bar there used to be a bar.So when the Chinese guy bought the bar expandedall the people who went to the bar kept going to the Chinese place, you know, it's the type of people who you know at 2 in the afternoon.They're playing keno and drinking counties.And that's I'm going in this guy asked me if I had a cigarette and I'm like no, he's like, can I use your phone?I don't know why I asked but I'm like were you calling?And he Rambles off some Italian guy and then he kind of stops.He's like, who are you?You know, like maybe he shouldn't be giving me the number.Because he's drunk cuz you know, I was like, who do you think I am or something like that?He's like I know you know that I Know Who You AreAnd I'm laughing in the guy's face.Like who am I then I don't think you know, and then she's giving me this look like I'm some gangster, you know, I'm like dude.I'm just going in here to get Chinese food, you know.Find me in there waiting and I see him looking in the window at me.I was like am I going to get hit while I'm waiting here for Chinese food?Yeah.It would have been a big relief, you know a lot of pressure off my shoulders.I'm supposed to make her estimated tax payment today.Jesse's waiting on a check and we're going to mail it out today without having enough money.Hoping that check comes in.I got a closing on Friday, but that's not going fund until next Wednesday Wednesday.I don't know what to do there.I mean, I know they get a lot of estimates in and they don't cash them the day they get them.I doubt it's going to be a week.The state is pretty quick.That's only a hundred something dollars.So it's not too bad.I would have had most of the money but my car payment hit today.Yay car payment.I'm also trying not to bounce that $1,500 check where the client fired me.So, I don't know.It's like I'm at the mercy of the IRS asking them for this offer in compromise.One of the things they look at is that you're making your payments.In fact, it is a violation of the terms not to make yourSo while we're technically not under agreement yet.One of the considerations is you know, what happened to the 4th quarter estimated tax, but once again, I'm not freaking out about it a week ago.I was you knowWhy?Yeah.I don't know just that one day.I think it's been part of it was ability to get into the office and do some work, you know, at least yesterday.Although I didn't finish that title, even though I wasn't so I think that's helped.That's why I'm wondering if the adderal Works how much that will change things.Just getting work done take a couple extra one and I'll clean the apartment Sir Speedy and if they don't work, I'm just going to sell the rest of the bottle.I could probably do better than the Klonopin.Yeah, you know.It's like I just have to wait until fish comes back to town and walk through the parking lot.No, because once the show is over.They have to stay up all night raging.That's why you no suspect I've never taken she asked me if I had ever taken stimulants before and I pause because I used to take ephedrine in college when it was legal.Or is it acid rain?I'd stay up late to work to party to play rugby.I use it as a stimulant this was before I really drink coffee.No.Yeah, it was very effective.But you know, they stop the sale.I mean you could go into a convenience store and buy it.Is tops that you know, it's a bronchodilator.So, you know, I forget the medication but there was an over the counter that had it in it before they stop.And when I would take it I felt weird, you know, so I stopped I was just like this is crazy.So I turned to coffee because there was a story of a model in Florida that died taking a bunch of it.It was also used for weight loss.So I think I might have even been taking it for that as well.It definitely suppresses the appetite.We're supposed to get some snow tonight.And of course just wants me to take Ian to school in the height of the storm.I've got to get up early.It's like yesterday.I slept I kept waking up but ultimately didn't motivate until like 10 just because I was tired from the game standing and watching and snowboard and then going and standing for another all day, you know.My section stands the whole game.Because our angle, you know, we're in the corner.We just stand the whole game and tailgate there are chairs but I stand and my legs were pretty sore yesterday and progressed a little bit on snowboarding.I think they were going a little higher up.So they were going a little faster while all the other kids didn't need help.He was holding instructors hands going down the mountain.What's the game being at 6:30 on Sunday?I won't have to worry about getting him out of there right away.I might try and see if I can get him some extra runs.He's never done that tow rope.They've got a little bunny Hill like the teaching Hills have magic carpets what she did fine when all the other kids are hopping right up on it and he's like inching forward, you know, he's a cautious kid though, but after the lesson, there's just the bunny slope which has a tow rope.I don't know if I'm allowed to run alongside him as he's going up this thing to pick him up when he falls because they'll shut the tow rope off.But someone's got to pick him up or you ain't getting up.But I've been brushing him out of there where you know if she wants to take some more runs.He's got a lift ticket until noon or something like that.Yeah, I think you know he even said he had fun even with to him.He doesn't see it as a regressing.He likes it.I wish the bathroom and did my morning juking routine, which has been less and less and less.Sunday morning was I think because we went over to Mosby's house and I was drinking.And so I think it may have to do with the dehydration a lot, too.Or even if I'm just dehydrated from drinking coffee, or just not drinking water, you know.The recently I've been trying to drink more water, but I have to get up and pee more.This morning, I woke up.I wasn't nauseous, right?assholebut I came back into the TV room and he was in his PJs, but he had a snowboarding helmet on you know, if he doesn't pick it up this year.I'll do lessons again next year.He has it in him.You know, I think he's just a little nervous about falling.And I kind of Whack Him on the head, you know, and he's kind of sensitive same thing was with his bicycle helmet, you know, he starts crying when I do it, but for me, it's just habit.You see a helmet you a kit.Instructor accidentally bumped into his head when he was sitting down and I could tell he kind of wind a little bit about that.I don't know if his helmet doesn't fit him or he's just sensitive, you know, so to make him stop crying.I told him to hit me in the head.He's not very strong.It's like harder harder harder.You started working on his derby car.Oh God.Well, at least you know every year I'll be a little better.But he wants to do a bumper car which entails adding wood to the top which you know.Just the way a bumper cars shaped.The size of the block is not big enough.So you've got to build up the back.And build up the front.I don't know he wants to put football stickers on it.I went to the kubz Scouts store to look for some stickers, but nothing really jumped out at him, except all the badges and pins and buckles.He was supposed to get a badge but there was a miscommunication among Scout leaders, and he didn't get it.I'm really not even sure you've got to do what they call a go see it where they went to the fire department something with your family.I think some of the activities they do you qualify for the old folks and getting them cookies and make Christmas cards for them, you know.I think that's the community event, but stupidly I told him oh you're going to get your badge.But he was so into the car and they also made these bracelets out of parachute cord.that hethe badge was the farthest thing from his mind.His leader is a bit.I would not leave him alone with his leader.Yeah.And the wife is always there.Yeah, it's a general level of creepiness.It's not like, you know, he's done absolutely nothing to suggest pedophilia or affection for kids.He's actually bit introverted, but he seems overwhelmed and he's taking classes for something.I don't want to talk to the guy so I don't really know all the answers, you know.But he's in class for something and he's overwhelmed.Yeah, he's just a weird dude.Just so weird dude, you know, but I wouldn't take a chance.CNN died in May are going to spend the night on a battleship.You sleep in the bunks and eat in the mess hall.They do tours around the battleship and all kinds of activities.Unfortunately, we've got to wait until May the fundraising that they do they used to subsidize these things.So instead of it being $55 a person.It was only $30 a person.It's still expensive but notfree weekend to entertain him and have fun.It's an overnight.That's not out in the woods where Jess is freaking out about Lyme disease, you know.That's going to be the interesting thing next summer, whether she'll let him go on an overnight in the woods.It's almost not even worth doing it because I'mgot to be wearing a full beekeeping suit.Yeah, we'll see tomorrow.I have nothing on the docket.So we'll see what happens.I've got a bunch of titles I need to do.So it's supposed to work immediately, right?So we'll see if I'm productive tomorrow.I hope I'm productive today.Actually been trying to plan if I do the titles today, then I can do my laundry tomorrow.I probably could bring my computer and do titles while I'm doing my laundry if I was but I won't do that.Yes closing on Friday.Hopefully I get my docs tomorrow.I'll have to work on that.But I have a feeling don't come late on Thursday.I'm more worried about you because have you gotten the flu shot yet?Well now it's probably too late.They say it's raining.But that might come back so don't get sick.I guess last time you suggested that I should not monitor.Tanya's mood on a day-to-day basis, which I think is good advice.I'm just sitting there thinking that it's maybe been a little bit harder than I anticipated.So I've been doing that Latonya also appears much better than I think she is in some ways.I think she's very anxious and very fragile.We talked about her not wanting control.I think she wants control more now than she has four months, but maybe can't handle it fully either.With her wanting control of her life again.She wants to take care of me because I important to her.As I mentioned some time ago.I don't know that I really trust her right now.There's a limit to what I can accept from her.It just is I guess.So we're in this place where she wants to take care of me and maybe I'm a bit standoffish and she just wants to talk about what's bothering her.That's fine normally but it seems like I don't know there's some strange sense in which the better she gets the less I can deal with their problems.It's kind of like when she's in an acute crisis.I can just deal with that.That's not a problem.But when she's appearing better, some of it just makes me angry or brings out that I am angry or something.She's anxious that she's not going to get a job.She started talking about how she sort of been sold the stream that you can go and get a Humanities degree and you'll get a job afterwards.That was a dream.She had always been sold.She had a whole lot of people getting her bad advice.It's just factually inaccurate.It just is not the least because in her first three years, she got a one degree and then she spent another year getting another degree instead of graduating early because she recognized that she couldn't get a job with the first degree.This is the conversation.We've been having for our entire relationship, but there is some sense in which her degrees do not lead to jobs.That's not why she was doing them, but now she can't get a job and that's a problem.I could recognize while it was happening that she was really just upset and looking for an outlet for being upset, but I couldn't stop also not being angry about her misrepresenting our conversations and the conversations.She has had with a lot of good people who had advised her in one way or another that there are three things to consider.Also when one is getting an educationI think I feel guilty that I just can't handle all of it.But there's also a sense in which I acknowledge that I have limits and I seem to be running into some of them and ask it suspects for question of what are real limits and what are not real limits.So what should I just work harder at and what is actually a limit?I don't know exactly why.I've been feeling more angry at it.I think there's a sense in which Tanya wants to have her life back and have it be okay and wants toyeah, I'm not exactly sure don't actually she asked if we were okay and so we had a conversation which after thinking a while about whether I said anything or not acknowledge that I was angry that her illness or her actions were some Spectrum in there has really hurt me over the last several months and that I just need some time to recover from that.I don't know if I should have had that conversation or not.I wasn't sure while I was having it.It seems like the only path forward when asked directly.Yeah, I think it's something like as he knows since you've been seeing me the whole time and you remember all of it.I've been hurt a lot over the last several months.It's hard your art some real ways in which she has abandoned me.She's threatening to kill herself several times.Not in the like I'm going to kill myself.If you don't do this sort of way, but in a defective sense coming close to a suicide attempt is a threat to kill herself.I think we were outside of the crisis.I have injured emotions.I think that's the primary source of what's been going on, but I don't.It's sort of like the more she goes back to being normal that part isn't knowledge.So there's no sense in which I want to wallow in it or do well on it or hold her accountable for it.But saying that makes it sound like I just want the pain acknowledged.That's a good question.I didn't really feel like she could know but then we had the conversation where she asked me directly if we were okay, so I sort of put it out there anyway, because there is a sense in which itself is an act of trust for me trust is in part built by trusting a little more than might be reasonable and seeing what happens.You can build a considerable amount of trust in that way but in smaller risks.I think it's too soon to tell whether she actually can or not, but she could in that moment.Acknowledge that of course, I would be hurt by those things.I don't think she thought about it very much.She said she hadn't really thought about her coming close to killing herself hurting me.She was most mostly just happy with herself for not having killed herself.All right, that's pretty okay, but it is also missing the effects on me and on everyone else in both of our families.Yeah, even if they didn't care about her at all, it impacts me so they would care about it, but they do care about her.They all love her a lot and have for years.Now.It's hard.We talked some months ago.I was talking with them a lot.But what am I supposed to tell them and not tell them at some point?I just don't need to tell in some sense.I need not to tell them that she wants tried to kill herself.wellIt takes me awhile to trust people.I don't know.Maybe that hurts me less now.So I'm more okay saying it.I don't know that was back in November.That incident happened, I think.Yeah, she didn't actually attempt, but I think I don't know how you draw that line.There's a plan there's preparation.Our families gets into this question of how do I let other people take care of me?And how do I take care of them also and not ask them to carry too much.And then how do I balance all that with Tanya's name or seems needs at the same time?It's been a very hard optimization problem.The end result is that her father finally visited 2 weeks ago, but she hadn't wanted to see him before then and basically just wouldn't let him come.He wouldn't talk to him either.So it is like the burden on me.The burden is on me to communicate how she's doing.And then also tell these people who love her and her family's impulse is always just to show up and be there which in some ways is a really good impulse and in some ways, maybe not a great impulse.I think mostly it's really good.A little planning.Sometimes a good thing.It's how these people who really love her and want to be there for her.That's not what she wants right now.Even will not being sure that what she wants should count right now.So clearly taking some of her desires off the table is reasonable.I have two brothers and sisters and particularly.My sisters really want to be there for me and take care of me.But again, it's like at what point as far as the time issues we're getting into half a dozen or a dozen people.I can't talk to all of them everyday.I can't talk to you.I suppose if I talk to each one of them once a week we could talk for a little bit of time.There's no continuity of the area across people.It's just really bad.The whole thing is just really bad.There's often not an extent to which just talking about it helps sometimes for me knowledge is a really useful particularly when you get to the 3rd or 4th thing that's worn off.Now I'm just passing on Grief to someone else.Yeah, the whole thing has been pretty complicated in terms of our families.On another level it becomes another logistical challenge, which is I guess who I'm talking about it even though it's also a lot of other things.You're so many other logistical challenges that I've been handling over the last number of months.I just don't have the energy for some of them also.I think it's something like the more important something is to me.Harder, it is for me to talk about so I have to trust in someone more in order to be able to talk about it.The only thing I think that plays into that one is that I didn't start seeing you until the end of January or February somewhere in there as just us.So before then there was an extent to which I didn't talk about something because we were still doing in theory something like couples counseling.No, sorry.It was just you and I but the patient was a relationship at the time in an official capacity and not me.That changed some of the things that I talked about like I didn't tell you about Tanya having this emotional affair until you were treating just me.That would be a reasonable feeling.I'm not sure I have any reason that's anywhere is reasonable is thatI don't know as I have an articulated reason for it, which is interesting.I think it relates to some knowledge of or trust in response what response I will get immediately and where it will go from there.I think.On the one hand and this is not as much an issue in our relationship, but the other person may not be able to handle it.That one is alleviated by some sort of special trust in this case.mitigated not reallysomewhat mitigatedLet's take a different one.See I was to talk to my mother about tonya's relationship with his Professor.I don't know how my mother would respond but it could go that my mother is angry or hurt and then I have to deal with those also and that hasn't helped me at all.Yeah that has to do with there's some amount of trust I put in you because this is your job.But I think I've mentioned before that.I don't trust that many people to do their jobs very well.Absolutely, so that's why I said change that because it's not like just you having this job makes me trust you.In a sense, that's a way of starting to put trust in you.I feel like you've been very helpful to me and you've done your job very well.And so I can trust you much more in some sense.Yeah, it's not like I haven't told anyone that she's suicidal.But how many details do they need?I feel like the details drive it home or make it hurt more.They make it more real.Suicidal is kind of a fairly big word.Right in both cases.We've talked before about me having some sort of Need for control and need to protect other people and take care of other people.I feel like the same thing is going both second stanzas in a sense.I am protecting my mother and I am protecting Tanya in the case of Tanya wanting to kill herself.I'm not protecting Tanya as much becauseI don't think there's that much more conveyed about her state in some way but the impact on my mother or whoever would be greater with more details.Yeah, I feel like you're either hoping that they can handle the same circumstance better or that the circumstances less like you somehow the only person I talk to you about Tanya's relationship is my best friend and that's because Tanya almost told him or told him most of it but not enough so he called me and said what's going on but then I was in this position position of do I sit there and blunder about what's going on or I could tell him and that seemed clearly less bad, but there's a sense in which it's not so much that he could handle it better, but it wasn't as painful for him if that makes sense.Yeah.Yeah, I think that's right.I think what I'm doing is just quibbling a little bit about your suggestion or in suggesting a way in which they might be able to handle it better.But of course the place you're taking it back to you is that I currently have been able to handle things better than other people.Yeah, there's also a sense in which how many people need to handle that simultaneously.I'm sorry, you're going to have to expand on that a little bit.You don't think those two are the same thing.My response is exactly the second one, but I know how to manage information and I know how to do these logistical things.So I go to those things because they're so lovable or closer to solvable.What do I do that?My wife want to kill herself?You can on the Practical problems and they are the practical problems of who needs to know.What and what do I need to do to make it from one day to the next?Eventually, I just asked my mother to manage information flow to my siblings and I just talked to her I guess on some level I agree.I don't know.I always end up in charge of things.No, I think the Mormons are good as some sort of Benchmark.I don't know why I always end up in charge of things.Some things I end up in charge of because I want to be speaking much more generally then like the specific illness.Music graduate student advisory Council in Ohio in the department of biomechanics that I ended up being co-chair of I didn't want them committee.I was elected while actively campaigning against myself.I did not want to be on the committee in the first place.I did not want to be the chair or co-chair this committee and I ended up doing it.Anyways his sense actually because no one else would and I could be convinced to do it and I don't know why I always end up in charge of things.Right.So then you have to sort of wonder if I weren't there what would happen something would happen.I presume these organizations would not all part entirely.If I hadn't been there, what would have happened?I think Tanya's family would have come up and handled that or she would have killed herself, but then we're getting into.If I work here this whole situation would be radically different.Anyway, we're so far off of counterfactuals.We could actually observe that I'm not even sure what difference it makes.Yeah.I don't know.just sort ofnothing much.Particularly.Just how did we get to hear?What would her family do?Otherwise, how do I end up in situations like these?What do I do?I sort of do what seems best as best as I can figure it out then I'm in charge of it again.Yeah, yeah.Then again, I'm not telling his therapist.So I feel like at least occasionally.I've come up with a different answer to that question.You know, I think it all would have been so much different if we would have been in San Antonio San Antonio or in Austin somewhere close to our families.The distance just add some extra logistical Dimension to it or something.It makes it I don't know.I guess it makes it so everything has to be planned.Somehow.I'm not sure.Yeah, I agree that particularly in college when people get sick.They go home fairly often.Yeah, my friend Frank or friend prank on my best friend is here in Andover.He went with me a lot.I let him take care of me a fair amount.It's easier because he's here.I don't know the hurdle of traveling with large.But then why are we here?We're here becauseIt's true for a while.We were here because Tanya was going to school and then we were here because Tanya had Chad here and it has been hard for her to find a therapist with whom you can actually work.Well or at least it seemed hard to her.I think really she's actually liked everyone she's seen not in the hospital in Andover very well.So I think maybe there are some left over by a Seas from poor treatment when she was young.Okay.Thanks.I figured you were running late.It's chilly out.I didn't get coffee.So if I seem slow and unable to think I have closing today.Which I've gone to squeeze.I just got another day with all kinds of stuff.It kind of stresses me out to have to have things all lined up throughout the day.The club got to meet Jess's mom to put the carseat in the car so she can go pick up Lucille.She wants to take Ian.So it's not a shocking for Lucille.So they need both car seats.Then I've got to go back and get eaten for Cub Scouts.It's the big pack meeting.I've never been to a pack meeting.So I don't know what we're going to do there and sleeping over.No, I'm just a dull in the Cub Scouts.You've got to go with your kid.You don't just drop them off which I imagine.Maybe the older kids just get dropped off.I don't know.It's going good.I tell you how I lost my bedroom.He's going to sleep in my bed tonight.He's going to learn to skate tomorrow.It's going through March that seems like an awful long time to teach kids to ski, I would think that at some point they give them a stick and a puck and I don't know.So I got to do that.Tomorrow is Cub Scouts are visiting a fire station at 10 meet.I really got the winner's share of the farm all male players on my team are going out Saturday night and Sunday.I have a football game.Well, hopefully and we'll go to bed early Sunday morning.I'll probably end up sleeping late.I'll probably be a little hung over.The whole thing just makes me anxious.I don't know if it's just the closing that makes me anxious or if it's having all of these things to do at a week.Of a week of a kind of coming home and just doing titles and working from home.I've been going to the office but going home in the afternoon.There's no real pressure or stress on me to get things done or should I have got I mean I have got plenty of time.I've already got.I had to order an uploaded updated playoff.So I've been waiting on that.I want to tell dr. Micah on Tuesday apps for she was cutting back my well room.And then in the very end, she asked me are you depressed and I go a little bit she was like, oh, we don't want to go down on the Wellborn if you're depressed, so I have to lie to her next time.No, I'm not depressed.I'm feeling great.I just wake up.I see you're after Thanksgiving.I'll try it then.I'm glad you're picking up on these things.I couldn't remember.She said to go up on the Prozac and I can't remember if she told me not to go up on the Prozac but I'm going up on it.Anyways now taking 25mg of the laundry.a lot of my green in the morningthe West series castmore so I'm taking a hundred at night and 25 in the morning.I think she's trying to get me on that and the Prozac and that's it.Maybe the copper play.I don't know as needed which is all the time.I don't seem anxious when I go to bed because I fall asleep on the couch and I wake up all discombobulated.But not being anxious.Yeah.Or just if there is some pick up somewhere.I'm always wary of hiccups, you know, like they just forgot to get a baby at banks.Are they going to be able to get a big truck?They've got to bring like 6,000 closing?So is she going to have time to do that?Maybe she will maybe she won't I don't know.I'm not going to risk.The of a personal check for $6,000.I guess you have tothe only way to be safe on a deposit in 10 days is 10 days.Yeah, I guess maybe at that point.You can't dispute it against another bank.Right.So Bank of America.If you depart deposit large amounts of money will hold it for 10 days, which I tell people they should get it get wire first.I tell them they shouldn't do Bank of America, but they should do they should get the money wired because the bank takes too long.I didn't have anyone to go to the game.So I sent out an email.I'm now going to get now getting all of these emails.Is it time are we done?There was a lot of traffic toNo, not really.It's like I did some work this morning taking a shower.I don't know why I just always feel is a chore, but I had to take one today after two weeks.I'm going to take a shower.I need a haircut.I should have gotten one today.I always by Supercuts I think.You get a $100 haircut.is Ghanait's always a roll of the dice.When you go to Supercuts.You never know.If you're going to get shockingly.My hair is not easy to 10.They're afraid of me being bald and then on the top if it's too short, it sticks straight up.I'm like just cut it short it will grow back.It saves me money because it's the less.I have to get my haircut cut it short.I'll let it grow long.A girl like 4 times a year.The break defends on the year.I was hoping we were somehow going to avoid and playing hockey.It's just very expensive.You've got to buy him equipment every year they can get used equipment but there weren't any used helmets had to buy a new helmet just bought them.So I don't care as much at some point it gets expensive.It should be entertaining though him learning to skate falling over all over the place those little kids he hasn't signed up.So I'm anxious about that.I forgot to sign him up and we're bringing the check.You know the one you know where the YMCA YMCA is there is a rank two blocks from the house.He's already been to the Firehouse butI guess not this Cub Scout stuff is kind of frequent.There's a lots of things to do.There's another meeting.There's a dead meaning.I'm trying to get all straight between dens last pass.Yes.stalkers gonebut yeah, he's got a lot of energy, you know, if he just sit around the house.He just bounces he doesn't do it when he comes over to my place.He just kind of sits things out and watches cheap we go out to dinner and his mellow but when he's home with Jesse pushes her out a lot more than he pushes me and talk to you doesn't really push me at all.Just not listening.Don't bring stuff in here and he brings the food in here.Don't bring food in here and he brings the food in here.Right, so I don't know why he acts really different with me just probably because he's around her enough that he knows her buns.He hasn't figured out mine yet or maybe Sears me I took a.m.When he does come over and he does spend a lot of time downstairs running around so he gets a lot of his energy out there so loud.That's probably it.It sounds more like Jess.Or is it just trying to get attention?easiest to me ignoring himI don't know him that much.Yes, so many damned questions.Yeah.It'll be interesting.He doesn't seem I don't know he's kind of skinny.So it's like I don't know how he would get do getting banged around in hockey when they're little they don't go flying into each other.They just kind of bingen to each other and fall down.They don't know what they're doing unless they have another brother and then they dominate I noticed that with soccer all the kids with all her brothers were much better.I had a kid who scored 7 goals who had all who has two older brothers.Like Lucille when she starts soccer, she'll be much better than one even started because she already been kicking around a ball Lucille's another year-and-a-half.It will be two and a half years before she can play instead of being cranky sitting in our little stroller at some point.She'll become more wanting to play and run around.She does that sum to but sometimes she just wants to sit in the stroller and being cranky.She doesn't want anyting else starts early.You'll see you see you're choosing your words carefully.Are you coffee?I'll go home to make coffee.It's such a pain though.Go home the three or four minutes.It takes it takes a while.You got to go you got to wash the pot out empty the thing put in the filter and put the coffee in.I don't know why he's a little things in life should just get in my way the hiccups.I wonder if Lucille is going to go with her grandmother when she picks her up today.I'm hoping I'll be upset if she doesn't.She doesn't go Mama Mama Mama Mama stand up in the car seat and go no.That's what you did to me.I do not want to go with me when we got home.She literally stood in the driveway was going Mama Mama Mama Mama.Don't you want to play she went mama mama mama, so I just sat down and waited it out.Luckily just was only 10 minutes.Yeah, she doesn't see me often enough.I haven't seen her since Saturday.Yeah, and I always for long periods of time.Sometimes she won't interact with me if she's cranky.There should be a coffee shop in this little square.You can never have too too many coffee shops at some point.I'm supposed to feed him.I got to figure out what to do.It's such a pain in the ass.Okay, that's right next week.I hope you weren't worried.That I do it enough.Hi.Good fun day at work.Yeah.What's on my mind?Sorry just like because I on Thursdays.I'm at work.So I just haven't.Stop thinking about work task because it's only like two blocks away from here.So just from one place to another.Yeah, I'm only there two days a week, but it could be a full-time job.So there's a lot to get done in a small amount of time that I am there.But I guess so we're back in Chicago at my parents house this weekend.And I finally talked to my dad and my brother a little bit about what their experience with their anxiety are and they both have been seeing people for years now, but nobody ever thought to tell me that I should do the same.So yeah, I always thought that I had it worse than everybody else in the family, but it doesn't seem to be the case.My dad was telling me that he really struggles with that and my grandmother apparently really struggled with depression my dad and most of his siblings.He was the youngest of five and three or four of them all also had a pretty bad anxiety and get panic attacks.I didn't know that my brother was seeingSomebody either but they were both really supportive.So that was nice.Is coming in a way to know that I didn't somehow get like the worst of it but then knowing that it's so bad for everyone.You know, it's like oh man.Like I guess this is just part of like in my jeans.It's just part of my life.So it's also kind of weird to think that okay.Maybe I'm not going to ever get rid of it, you know.because my dad was saying he tries his best, but they're definitely periods of time when he really I mean he getsIt was like he was saying that he was feeding feeling like that's the same thing.I feel dad.He was saying that he was always just thinks the worst is going to happen.I was like, that's what I think all the time.You know with Amelia doesn't text me back.I'm never going to see her again, you know something horrible happened to her.So it's comforting actually I think more so then the not knowing that you know, they also deal with this.Yeah, I didn't somehow just end up this way that nobody else did.Yeah, I never knew I never really knew that they ya know it's definitely really new information for me.Yeah, well, it's that's what he projects.I know it's funny.I wouldn't to Wesley Tuesday to hear talk and some of my classmates and professors and I'm not on campus this semester.Obviously the first thing that every one notices that I've lost like 15 pounds because I've been sick.So I was talking to one of my advisors about work and everything and kind of joking around about my ulcer and she saysYou're really the last person I would ever think I would get an ulcer.You just seem so calm and laid-back all the time.All I could do was laugh because that's the opposite.How I feel about people that don't like really know me not that she doesn't know me well, but where we have a professional relationship, maybe I come off the same way.My dad does.I don't know because I always thought my dad ugly as a laid-back one compared to my mom.I don't know.Well, and I think for me like in a professional setting like I don't get all of that worked, you know, and I've done mix and at work, I'm very efficient and things don't really like writing papers or having these professional and academic test doesn't really I mean, I'll be like, oh, I've got to get this one, but I get it done and I do things well, and I think that in those settings people won't necessarily think that I'm up type or stressed out.totallywhen I'm busy or it's like less time for me to think about other things in about my anxiety, like for example yesterday.I was at my other job where I have a lot of it's just not a structure and I don't feel as productive.I'm not sure why that is it's just maybe because I still I don't know maybe it's just it's two different working environment.I feel like I have a lot of time where I'm just kind of sitting around not necessarily like go go go like the way that I am at work.So I feel a lot more anxious yesterday.Where about where Amelia was and what she was doing compared to today.We touch base maybe one or two times via text message, but that was it and it didn't really bother me at all because I was just busy and I knew that I had x y and zThings I needed to get done before I got out of the office.So I do like it better when I have a structured environment with lots of things going on for me to focus on that.Aren't my anxiety.I think that's why I don't really like being by myself all that much.Like when I'm at home waiting for a milli or something like that, you know when I first get home.Yeah, it's very rare that I have an afternoon in the apartment by myself that I'm excited.Most people would be excited to lay on the couch and do nothing and have nobody there to know that they're being lazy, you know, I don't really I used to have that I used to get excited when I can have the afternoon to myself but I don't really have that anymore.I tried to fill my time with other things on Wednesdays for Amelia is at school until 9 at night.So one day once he's like my night to try to go see some friends or something like that and keep myself at work later do something right after work, so I'm not just home by myself.I didn't ask if he had ever.I don't know.I mean, I would assume that we you would have told me if you ever tried taking medications because we are talking about how he manages the symptoms.He says that is why he works out.Fanatic lie all the time to try to keep himself calm, but it doesn't necessarily help my brother and I only talked briefly as we were walking from dinner to another point, so we didn't really get into too much stuff.I've been I'm finally feeling better like today and yesterday I'm eating a little bit more now and I feel like either I'm going to get used to the medication or I wasn't really having side effects at all, or maybe a mentally getting used to the fact that I have to take medication.I'm still kind of like I just want to know want this to be over you now and the whole reason that I have a ulcer in the first place is because I was taking too much Aleve for my sensitive stomach combined with my stress.But the reason I was taking so much relieved was because I got really painful periods and so my cycle came a week early this morning, but I can't take anything.So I'm just not because I'm focused on that right now.I'm focused like just trying to get through having really bad cramps and not being able to take any painkillers for it that maybe I'm not so I'm likeIt's weird, but it's kind of nice to be having a health situation that I'm familiar with.I'm okay.I'm like, okay, these cramps are.You know what?They are.I'm not worried that I'm having ovarian cancer because I'm having cramps right now, you know, like this has happened to me my entire life.It sucks that I can't take anything for it because I'm uncomfortable but it's distracting me from the ulcer stuff and from the possible side effects of ulcer medication, so I don't feel all that stress about it at the moment.Cuz I'm distracted I guess.Yeah, because this you know, it's not like something new and maybe I'm not stressed because I'm not taking any medications to take Tylenol.So maybe I'm stressed about it.I'm allowed to take Tylenol, but I don't want to take it.I don't know.It makes me nervous and I think that I'd rather.Because the reason I was on it so much Aleve is like two Advil doesn't mean anything do anything for me.So in my head I'm like, well Town knows not going to do anything.So while I was taking it and having something else happen.I don't know like I'm not supposed to I know it's not a blood thinner which is why I can't take it because I just had the buy Topsy the last week.So I'm not supposed to take Aleve or Motrin or any blood thinner.I was just convinced it will make me sick because that's all the medication has done to me for the last you know what I mean, but I mean, but we've made me sick and send the medication they gave me first for my stomach made me sick and the medication they gave me to do endoscopy made me sick and it's like I just want to like I'm ready to go on a yoga retreat and drink herbs or something and get acupuncture and not deal with anymore Pharmaceuticals at this point.Yeah.No bad.I just I'm like, I don't know.I'm already taking one medication.So what's going to happen if I take another I don't like all that chemicals in my body.I don't know.It gives me that same feelings when like everytime.I swallow pill I get that feeling right there as this the day that I didn't either too much cocaine or lace cocaine or laced cocaine and it gives me that rush in my chest.It's like a panic attack.So maybe that day I didn't do something lice and I didn't overdose at all.Maybe I had a panic attack while I was high on cocaine totally possible because I can't really separate the two but it's that same feeling that I get when and it happened a couple nights ago to it's been hard for me to start eating again because for a month every time I ate I got really sick because I have no sir.So it's been difficult for me to start eating again and Monday night.I sat down for dinner and it was the first time I was going to eat some veggies and some actual food.That wasn't white tasteless.I start eating am I eat a little bit quickly because I was hungry now my appetite back which is good and no son.I felt that you know, it was like I had a panic attack after takinga couple bites of foodAnd I felt that Rush up in my it's like that warm feeling like my chest gets really hot.Almost like there is hot liquid shooting up from there.I thought I was going to vomit at first.Yeah.Yeah, I think so if that was a panic attack then I'm pretty sure that was the first time.Yeah, and I think that's why but maybe you know, I think that's where a lot like a lot.I'm not surprised that it's kind of feeling I get one like when I get a shot also, like I really hate vaccines and I had to get so many of them to go to Egypt just to apply to the Red Cross you had to get a school get the whole works, you know.Like I need to get my flu shot next week because of where I work and I'm really dreading it because anytime anything for an entered my body chemically, I don't like it and it gives me that same feeling.there wasI remember having a panic attack after I got one of my vaccines.Where was I going though?I don't remember I was still in college and my car so it was after this it was after that experience.Yeah, so I think that was the first time.Yeah, or that actually might have been the second time depending on if now in retrospect.I'll tell you about the day in a second.In retrospect I had a allergic reaction.So when I was 19 and I was having my first round of GI issues they wanted to do an upper GI Series so I like swallowed the chalky stuff.Then they were going to give me this IV to make it light up in the CT scan machine or something so they could watch as it goes down when they started the IV.Everyone said I had an allergic reaction but I stopped breathing and then got some hives and so they said I had allergic reaction but in retrospect this was still the same kind of like my chest got really hot.Although I think it might have been I mean, I'm sure I had allergic reaction if there's position saying you're having an allergic reaction, but I don't know maybeMaybe the cocaine thing was the second time.I'm not sure.Anyway, so that day my friend Marie was visiting.I had just gotten back from my trip Madagascar.It was maybe a month-and-a-half after going to volunteer in Madagascar which would wear my stomach problems kind of just I like started eating again and it's kind of like a combination weather eating issue issue I had once because there was no real option.Like I was just going to eat the food that was there because I couldn't really be picky but I wasn't getting sick.So I was like healthy again.I was still getting exercise.So I just got back maybe a month or month-and-a-half of my good friends who I had a huge crush on was volunteering with me.This was inChicago visiting she was living in Montana.So she came out to Chicago to visit and there was a bunch of other people that I'd volunteered with us who lives and kind of like the Chicago metro area.So we're all planning on getting together that night from our conversations getting to know each other while we were in Madagascar.I knew that Alex lights.2 we used to call it like to party or whatever and they did cocaine, so I thought this would be fun if we all get together and I'll get us a gram Coke to split and we can go out in Chicago.Have a good time.The plan was that we were going to first before we went out in that are friends Maria and I were going to meet my mom.My mom works in the city.So we are going to meet my home at our office and she was going to take us to the Red Cross information session that was being held in Chicago.The plan was not to do the cocaine before we went to meet my mom obviously, but I remember there was like some travel we didn't think you were going to get in the guy that I was supposed to get with from was not going to be able to come true.So we we were going to just not get it.And then last minute called me that he had it and we could pick it up.So it was like we were excited that we could got it because we didn't think we were going to and so we decided we would just do a little before going into the city.It makes me kind of nauseous even thinking about how we then like and we just put out these like I mean they were really big it was like more than I usually would do so early in the day.And before I was about to be driving from Greenwich to into the city if you'd like sick to my stomach that I did it.But I would think it was okay to do that.I thought it was okay to be snorting cocaine in the first place and I thought it was okay to drive myself and my good friend to meet my mom and go to the Red Cross information session.Like I don't even know what I mean.God and God forbid something were to happen.And then I'm having this panic attack.So we did some and it didn't feel right if burned in the cocaine is not supposed to burn it numbs you you knowAnd so for some reason I did all three lines and then was like, oh and Friends tried it and said don't do it.Like oh God you already did them.There's something not right with that.I don't know what it's it is but like I'm not doing anymore.Yeah, I mean it might have been a panic attack but remembering how I felt later.I was really sick from this.So we started driving and I was like blacking out as we were driving.I felt like I had this fever that like, I was just on this one.I don't think maybe it was part.well, if you knowYeah, exactly.Exactly.I didn't tell Marie what was going on.Somehow got us both into the city.I haven't really thought about this much in detail in a while.And I really can't believe this happened and that I'm fine.But I remember thinking in the car on the way down because my mom is going to meet us at the parking garage and I could remember thinking on the way down.I need to tell my mom.Either I either needed to pull over right now and call my mom.I need to tell her as soon as I get out of the car that she needs to take me to the emergency room because I snort something that it shouldn't have and I was like totally sick enough.that was okay for me to havemy parents were strict growing up and I was at the point where I was like, I need to tell my mom she needs to take me to the hospital before because I think I'm dying.I remember getting out of the car and my mom took one look at me and said it was like what's wrong and I was likeI just don't feel that well but she would never think that oh my daughter is on drugs she would think I have the flu you know what I mean like she would never think I was just like I don't feel well because I decided I think by the time we were there I was feelinga little bit and had passed a little bit so I think I decided that I was going to try just try like I felt really sick and I wanted to go through up somewhere so we went to the building where Red Cross thing was being held and it's a federal building so we had to go through security at this gram of coke look in my purse that I just stopped on the security belt nothing happened but I was just not with it at all I didn't even remember nothing about the channel I was in the bathroom trying to puke the entire time and I just kept looking at myself in the mirror saying you're going to be fine you're going to be fineAnd I was just like not with it and then I just came down.And I had a horrible rest of the night.No, I came down from it towards the end of the Red Cross session and said that I thought enough to stay out and that I just wasn't doing any more of it and I wasn't going to drink and I was just going to see my friends.I don't really remember really what we did.We went and had dinner and went to one of their apartments and I gave them the drugs and it was in that moment.I was like, I'm never doing that stuff again.I tried to do it once more when I went to Genevieve a couple weeks later for my semester abroad and while I was in I was like, maybe I'll give it one more shot because I really miss that feeling it gave me.Just like I'm like, it's the same feeling that I get now when I'm in the middle of a really good runner in the middle of a really good workout, and I have great music on and I have a high allergy and I can feel my muscles getting stronger, you know.It's like that like I just felt something awesome all I was on it.Like I just want to go dance and that's what we did.We would do cocaine and dance and it just made me feel like I was on top of the world.So I really remember really missing that feeling for a couple of years really missed feeling it gave you the feeling of gave me but I knew I could do it.So I didn't snore any of the in Genevieve's I just just tried to put a little bit on my gum, but Panic just set inNow I can't even like I used to smoke pot sometimes with my friends which kind of help calm me down and I can't even I can't do that anymore.It just makes me panic immediately when I was out in Oregon and one of them really has good friends has medical marijuana card for his anxiety.So she was like, why don't you just give it a try?I couldn't even I took in one.I inhaled once and then I had a panic attack.I felt like stuff that doesn't belong in.My body's going to kill me I guess.Yeah, I mean that they still and this was 6 years ago that day I can feel the way that I felt and it's horrible.It's fair and at this point, I don't even like I don't get like getting drunk, you know, I don't like being out of like being in control.I like feeling like I know what's going on and I can't roll what's going on.I felt really out of control that day like I couldn't stop what was happening.A year about a year not everyday mostly a couple times a week we would go out because that was the year.I wasn't drinking so it's so to me it was my substitute.Yeah, not for too long.I didn't drink in high school.I definitely wasn't one of the popular kids who got invited to parties.And so there is a couple of times that my friends parents would go away and we would get some beer, you know and hang out in her house compared to what other kids were doing.I was a really good kid and high school.I smoked pot for the first time on my younger brother gave it to me the night before I went to college.He was hanging out with school friends in my grade, but when I got to college I started drinking a lot.I don't remember in freshman year.I mean I was a mess freshman year like it took me a year to get my shit together.I failed intro to psychology.I think I decided I want to be a psych major and some a psychologist and then I was going to have my private I had this whole plan.I wanted to have a private practice, you know, like pretty much be sitting in your chair right now.And then I remember I failed in intro to psych.I took it again.I got an A just be okay, like now I can move on, you know.But I just didn't know it was carried over from high school.I never I was never great a great academics in high school.I was average may be a little below but I just didn't try I didn't really care and I don't know why this is my mom asked me a lot now, like what was your deal should we get calls from teachers like healthy would be doing great job, but she just doesn't do her homework that carried into my freshman year.Like I just partied with my friends.I just didn't go to class.I remember I would help my friends like oh classes optional and I would sit in my room and hang out and watch something but I never really liked when I just didn't really try except for my women's studies class, which apparently I cared about and I did well in that class, but then I don't know what happened.sophomore year that change that because all the sudden it was all theThe same time I start getting my weight under control.I mean granted I was starting doing drugs and I was on my way to potentially having an eating disorder.I started losing weight and even with all my GI problems, I made the Dean's List first semester sophomore year.I was in the library all the time.It helped that the girl I had a crush on was in the library all the time.It's in the library and not do her work.So I'll go to the library with her, but I would get it done.And I don't really know what changed but I just started.I don't know know what happened.I just came around and didn't get a decent, you know, but it took me a year.Yeah, my mom jokes around that she sent one kid off to Yale where I went to school and another one and got another one back because I changed so much throughout the four years.I was there.That's why I stopped drinking.Ants are doing cocaine.So yeah, it's weird because I can't be like, oh, I stopped drinking and started studying and exercising has a sister doing very very hard drugs and I was having health problems, but somehow I don't know what happened.I think I also started taking classes.I was interested in I think that has a lot to do like even now if I'm not interested in something is really hard for me to pay attention.I can speak it better at this point as an adult then I could I think in high schoolYeah, but I mean between those two years also made a lot of decisions, like personally I was going to confront my sexuality and I was starting to do that was starting to become more something but I couldn't ignore any more and I started dealing with it.I join the soccer team and it felt like I fit in finally likes about high school.I didn't really fit in feel like I said in freshman year still in really feel like I fit in because the people are I thought out to be friends with for the people that looks like the kids that went to my high school because that's where was familiar to me.I knew some of them.keep in touch with but they weren't who my real friends were, you know, I finally found out like a group of people that I set I just felt likeso I think that maybe had something to do with it.I felt more comfortable in myself.I don't know if I was always looking for excuses to not be confident, you know, so I was like I'm not going to do well in school.I'm going to keep overeating.No, that was just like the definite turning point though, like after freshman year when things really changed.I don't really know how my drugs have it fits in with that because it doesn't really make much sense to me.first time I tried it was it was like almost a week of freshman year inThe party and one of my friends had some I was really nervous.Like I was like this is going to hurt what's going to happen.It was that girl that I was like actuated with she was doing it.And so I was like, okay, I'll try it and I remember nothing happened.I didn't feel anything and I was like that's stupid.Like I don't feel it just because I had smoked pot throughout the year and liked it.So but like a can really freaked me out, you know, it's like that I've had always thought marijuana is with alcohol and then the rest of the drugs over here and I'm never going to touch them.Yeah, but I tried it and nothing happened and I remember I went to go hang out with my soccer friends and I was like, I just tried cocaine and nothing happened and they were pissed they want nothing to do with it and they didn't even want me to have anything to do with it bro my sophomore year.I never snorted cocaine around and I would lie to them and tell them I wasn't doing it and I had like my separate friends who are surprisingly now no longer my friends.Yeah, and then I didn't even think about it really all summer and it wasn't until I came back to school that those friends again.They had been doing it all summer.So they had it around so I give it another try.I guess I liked it.I don't really remember the second time.I did it.Yeah.Yeah, I remember there was one time we decide we tried it before class.And that was when after I did I was like, all right.I think this is when I noticed that my friend any who would like my cocaine buddy.I was like maybe we're on different pages with this if she's going to be doing this before class because at that point that was second semester, I made the Dean's List first semester.I was getting straight a second semester felt good to be getting good grades, and it's justI don't know cocaine was everywhere at my school.A lot of people did it and a lot of people go to the concentrate.A lot of the Frat Boys would take it to write their papers.And I remember people would be snorting it at the library.That was just never I don't know maybe because I figured out howTo soberly succeed academically first semester that I don't know cocaine for me was after my papers.We're done and we were going to the bar.Yeah, when we did it before class and made me really uncomfortable.I was really uncomfortable in class felt like I couldn't concentrate cuz it's still and I was worried that everybody knew that I was high and I was likeI was like I can't do it again.So it really stayed it stayed for me recreational.But when you're a college kid going out two or three nights a week, you know.Is frequent enough, yeahWhen we did it before class kind of sat back and re-evaluated how much I was doing it and whether is a good thing or a bad thing and I kind of had this bleeding clot.Like maybe I'm getting a little bit carried away, but I think I couldn't do it everyday and I couldn't do it every night because I wasn't a sleep so, you know, I didn't Tuesdays and Thursdays we had practice and Friday nights.We didn't go out because we had games every Saturday morning.So it wasn't like an option for me to do it on soccer days.I was still I was still as much as I like to party in the same went for pot in the same went for alcohol and marijuana again after I start drinking again.I stop doing cocaine for food to it's like a reward for working me.So after I finished with all my commitments and E2Be done with my homework have gone to all of my classes and it's like fun time, you know.And I'm still kind of like that now I'll I'll be like okay, if you get this paper done, you'll have a drink tonight, you know, or I'll let myself go in a fancy sandwich or something, you know, like I don't know so it's always I still kind of had them separate but in retrospect, I think my exercise and eating habits Maybe.We're not out of control than my cocaine habit because they were spiraling farther and farther.They were constantly like I was constantly changing my location and hub.It was kind of constant except for one day when I did it before class, but it was kind of a consistent like I would just do it when I was out and then of course one day when I did all that because I was excited about it.I never did it again.But it wasn't something that was constantly escalating but more the weight.I lost in the faster.I could run in the farther I could run.The more I wanted to eat less and run farther.Do you know what I mean?Going to Madagascar when I was in Madagascar.I probably gained seven or eight pounds back but I still look good for me because I was down to like under 19 before which is probably 10 lb less than I am right now.So I was probably like the size when I came home from Madagascar.I still felt good and I still felt like it looks good.But having been able to eat I was more conscious of how much I was exercising.So I was like, okay I'm going to eat more but I have to I'm going to exercise more it wasn't until I went abroad to Genevieve's that I really put the weight back on because I joined a soccer team team of the season ended early.So I pretty much stopped working out and started drinking again start been feeding.Oh, yeah binge eating.But not in front of people I would do it when I was by myself.Is embarrassing for me?Yeah at night and that's when I went right back to the Habit in Genevieve living in a studio apartment by myself was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me at this point because I would go out and just like that I would go.Out with a backpack and go get all this food and come home.And just sit and watch TV or something.I didn't do any homework somehow.I still got a raise but I think that's what happens when you're abroad like it doesn't I don't know.I'm not sure if it was just the structure of my programs was more about experimental learning because I was still got fine grades, but I didn't do any homework then study at all.I would just like to eat.How do you remember I would always like kind of sneak things because my parents are hellfreaks.And so we are never allowed to eat all the fun stuff other kids got and when I was kind of like a chubby kid and my parents were like a my brother is like a stick him in my dad.So I take after my mom and he takes after my dad and he's six foot tall and I'm like a pinky so we would have Jamie snacks, but I wasn't allowed to eat them.Jamie sorry, his name is Jamie like James.Yeah, likegamesHe would have Cool Ranch Doritos, and I remember the Doritos and I wasn't allowed to eat the Doritos as much as he was.I don't know.My mom will deny this now.I think but Jamie remembers we were laughing about it the other day.I was just a slower metabolism than he does.And I feel like as a girl growing up.I was just a little bit, you know had more weight on me.So I started sneaking things.Yeah.I don't know.I would either when I was younger, I would usually just buy extra snacks from the cafeteria at school or I tell my mom I wasmaking lunch money, but I would take more so I could get some extra snacks.Oh, yeah.Yeah, then once I could drive and high school, that's the end of it.I mean when I look back on it, IFeel like it was probably binging not to the extent when I was in Genevieve, but that that was really binging.I would go get three.Chamois sandwiches and french fries and just sit down and go to town when I was younger.Maybe it was or I would have extra meals.I feel like I remember these girls these good friends who I played softball with who were twins.They were really overweight to a we kind of like we just like to go to this 24-hour Deli would go there, you know like after we had already at dinner.That's true.It was a mix of both.I mean one.I had found out that I had eaten buddies then we would just never eat health healthy, whatever we get together.We would order the worst food for you possible.But there was still this element of when I was at home like specially at night after everyone we go to sleep.I stayed up and watch TV and eat.I know that it is unhealthy because well, I mean it was unhealthy because I was very overweight.But I remember I would sit down and watch TV, but it wasn't to watch TV.It was easy.I would turn on the TV but then as soon as the food was done like I was watching done watching TV.I still have that habit now like when I eat lunch,If there's a weekend or something or I'm by myself, I'll eat even if I'm eating a salad.I'll sit down like I I'll sit down and I'll turn something on.TV Elite my salad or whatever I'm eating and then when the food's done, then I turn the TV off and I go back to work or something like that.I still kind of have that part of The Hobbit, you know, butI so look forward to it.And that's why it's weird now.I don't have to look forward to having alone time because I used to look forward to it when I was by myself because that's when I would eat.Not great.I think kind of guilty but then when I started having my stomach problems when I was 19, what would happen is I would wake up the mornings after eating late at night and B6 my stomach so it turned into a physical thing.But yeah, I would feel guilty.But if I kept eating then I didn't feel guilty when I start eating more and more and more because the longer I was eating for the longer it was going to be before I started feeling embarrassed and guilty.So I think that's what happened in Genevieve like the more food.I brought back my little Studio the longer I'd occupy myself eating it the longer I can have the periods of Happiness before I felt like oh God, I can't believe I just did that.I mean this week yes, but not usually now.Yeah, not usually.Yeah.Yeah.I mean eating definitely does give me a bit of anxiety but not in the same way that medicine does so it's not like I'm eating that I can think something bad is going to happen today.It's just knowing because I always think.I'm still in a phase of Being Fit and being you know, like I'm not supposed to be skinny.Like I'm supposed to have meat on my bones and be strong and Kirby.So I don't think I'm skinny but fit always scared that I'm going to become that fax in again.And so I'm very very obsessed about what I eat a plan.I can plan my meals a lot but not like I portion control or make food the night before but I spend all day thinking about food.I wake up in the morning.And the first thing I think is okay what I'm going to have for breakfast.What am I going to have it and then what am I going to have for lunch?And if we're going out for dinner?It's like okay what I'm going to have for breakfast and lunch that will make me feel okay eating steak for dinner or how many miles do I have to run before I let myself have some chips and guacamole if we're having tacos or something like that.I'll let myself eat things.Like I'll still go out for a burger and I still eat fries sometimes but I make sure that I feel like I deserve it.Oh, yeah.Oh I brought my consent forms.Sorry, I meant to give them to you at the beginning so you could record so now that I have a regular appointment you can just bill me at the end of the month.So there is both of them for you.This bag is great, but you can't just open and shut it to get something out.Yeah YouTube.The WeekndI'm okay had a last Tuesday had a breakdown at work or I was fine in the morning.I was fine for most of the afternoon and then towards the end of the last like our that I was working.I started like shaking.And then I realized that I was panicking I was able to hide this from everybody but ended up, you know, leaving an hour early, which I mean isn't that abnormal for me especially because right now hurts my hands.But I ended up going to my parents place first because I didn't know that I would be able to make it.All the way back to Sydney, you know New Haven and so I ended up calling.Dr. Barnes decided like she called me back and so he put me back on the Seroquel.I know that's when I realized it was like it wasn't just the apartment or something because I don't normally Panic at work.Yeah.a week ago TuesdaySo I've been on for a week.I mean, I think it helps them.I was Panic free for a few days and then the past couple of days.I've been so like sad again and suicidal again, butI've been suicidal all along like for the past few weeks, but not as suicidal as I was when I was not on the Seroquel.I think it's helping.What's more like I was kind of really sad but usually like not that long but they weren't just like instant and go away.They were like maybe 5 minutes or so.This morning.I just sort of realized that because it was my birthday.And Sydney was we stayed up late the night before like we are going to go out and do this and then he like couldn't go to sleep and like, you know, you didn't bother taking an Ambien or you know NyQuil or what was my birthday.So then he was like sleeping in and don't even like I didn't get up until 10:30 and he didn't get up until like 11.I guess it's not that late butBecause I'm not seeing any friends because I don't have a place to host them.Like I don't my Apartments too small.I can't ever have a party and I haven't done things with friends in like forever and it made me really sad and I feel like I have no friends because Sydney is like why don't you just have a couple over and I'm like if I did the couple that I'd want to have when you Lucy in Walter, but they're you know, they move to Florida like a year-and-a-half ago now.Yeah, I just don't feel like I have any close friends anymore and I just couldn't think of any way then he was like, oh, well, you know where she was like trying to help but then I shot down his idea and then he got mad at me and he was like, okay I quit and I'm like thanks.I just feel so hopeless and I was considering like I didn't go into work yesterday either because I was sick on Monday.And yesterday I like Monday night.I was feeling really suicidal and bad depressed and I guess it wasn't me.I wasn't even suicidal.It was like the physical feeling of uncomfortableness and tightness from anxiety.That's what I was feeling.There might have been there was possibly a thought about like I should kill myself to end this feeling and the feeling wouldn't go away.I mean yesterday there was snow anyways, but I'm like this close to finishing my job and like considering quitting right before the end when like accept that was you leave on bad terms, but I just don't know that I could keep it together enough and if I keep on feeling like this like that tightness just wasn't going away.Yeah, like I can sort of put it away.Like if we were doing like something distracting like watching an episode of something or like listening to a podcast.But as soon as like the episode of podcast or whatever end it comes back.Well, it wasn't the tightness.It was like last Tuesday.It was shaking.I don't remember there being that tightness at work.Maybe there was I'm just so uncomfortable and I have no way of like going like making it go away permanently.It just seems hopeless and I just like, okay these drugs aren't stopping that feeling.No.It does go away.But I feel like I have no control over it.It's happening if it happens more and more and like it the Seroquel isn't going to help either then like I mean, I guess I it's helping some but it's not helping enough and like I can't you know, I don't know if the imipramine has stopped working or something and I can't really go back on the Wellbutrin because it's really bad for anxiety, and I'm just like I've run out of options.No, I haven't.But how am I supposed to like usually happens at night?It's so Snowy out.Like I have to wait for it to stop being snowy like I'm okay with walking in the cold but like not really walking like in the snow and like right now it's just so slippery out like even getting to the car to get here was like a challenge.I feel like I probably can't wait until the end of winter to like start exercising but I don't really have any other choices, like maybe I'll get because then I could have time and then I could join a gym or something or likeLike lots of running or lots of walking.Okay, because running in the mall.I think the winter is driving me crazy.Just hearing like, you know, when I find out there's going to be more snow is just makes me so sad andI can't deal with winter anymore.But there's really nothing.I you know.I mean unless I went on a trip somewhere.Yeah, but I need to finish up my job.And by the time I finish hopefully winter won't be as bad anymore.I want to be able to go on walks and stuff.Yeah, I don't really foresee myself having time to do it for the next few days.Well tomorrow I have work.And I'm going to go to work and get as much done as I can to try to finish up this.earlyIt's right to finish this up early.Then I Friday morning.I have my actual appointment with dr. Barnes.They're going down to Rhode Island, and I actually need to help cook because my mom has them.Did I tell you that like my parents have been fostering cats with kittens?So the new foster mom, her name is Kelly and she's she gave birth to kittens a week ago today or a week ago yesterday and like a right before she was giving birth like she started acting like really crazy like, you know, like she had been really nice and letting people pet her like acting crazy.Like if you stop petting her she'll attack you and now it's a baby's if you get too close to the babies are look at the baby's still attack you and she actually move them like she had them in the playpen area.That she liked took the kittens out and move them to like underneath the Hope Chest that had been like fenced-off where they weren't supposed to be going.But I mean, it's a safe place for now.But like I think sometimes she's been less crazy.But like she managed to bite into my mother Mom's hand the point like it got swollen and like she had to go to the doctor and they gave her medicine which wasn't like instead of like it hadn't done enough yet and rather than wait and see if the medicine would work.They want to give her the option of either going to the hospital or getting an IV that you can have at home.And so she has the ivy until Saturday.Do I need to help her cook, so not really a chance for a walk.Yeah.Work I can't really do that because it's just like there is the parking garage and then I have the past 2 and that's my free parking.Oh, okay.Yeah.I think I can do that.It just doesn't sound like it's going to be enough.I want to go on walks.I really do just driving through the snow with my snow boots and things being slippery.I hate it so much.But I really should at least be taking the stairs instead of the elevator at my place.I know it depends sometimes on the way down not usually on the way up, especially if I'm like carrying heavy stuff.Depends on the day but usually the elevator on the way up and usually the stairs on the way down.I guess it depends on what I have on when I had on the day that I had my backpack in my computer.Like I guess I could have I was just afraid I was going to hurt my back like carrying it up the stairs.I don't carry that much on me I could.It's on the it's on the third floor, but the ground floor has one.So it's two two flights up.No, it really didn't.I mean she was like, oh we can take because we still have some boxes like my parents came up over the weekend and help but I still have some boxes and don't really have a place to put them it would have been too hard to move everything out in time.Probably yes go out to a restaurant or maybe if someone else really tells me I don't know it's not like any of my friends suggested getting together.Maybe it's just that I'm sort of I feel a little bit uncomfortable with that because then it's like, you know suggesting an activity that people have to spend money on.I mean which I guess is okay and also like pending weather or they eat kosher and that's going to be an issue.I guess most of my friends don't possibly all of my friends they can of at least like Dairy food out in a restaurant or non-kosher restaurant.Yeah.I'm not sure.Yeah, I don't know maybe like Phillip and Amy, maybe likeI haven't actually gone and rejoined yet.And it feels weird that if I were doing it, like you know right after I got like if I'm going to make Sunday my first rehearsal like being like hey, let's all get dinner like right before the rehearsal so that people that like, I mean, I know most of the people in the group right now, I think they only have like three new members but still a little bit weird suggesting it when I haven't actually rejoined the group yet because like the following weekend, I won't actually be able to come to rehearsal.So I'm like do I want to start when I can't make all the hurdles yet, which is still in a way because I actually like that like even if I'm only going to have rehearsals for now, that's still more rehearsal then if I wait to get back,So also just afraid of the time commitment and stuff.But if I'm going to be unemployed again, it's not going to be that bad and if I can get a reasonable job at like is around here, you know, you know.Yeah.Actually in that now that more hours anymore.I think there isn't any you know, all the drama is gone like all the dramatic people finally left.Yeah, I'm just afraid I don't want to be like a and stuff and like I'll have to miss like next weekend.I have an event and then like there are two weeks that I'm house-sitting for my parents will there in Israel?Yeah.Yeah.Okay, she'll probably call the my doctor.I guess I can do that.It's scary.I guess I'm afraid with music that the time commitment is due and not being able to make rehearsals are feeling trapped at I have to go to rehearsal and I'm like really sad or something.I missed rehearsal and end up staying on the wall and crying and feeling a tightness and not having it go away.I guess if I missed too many of rehearsals and getting kicked out that probably would happen.I've also never been this depressed and trying to be in an acapella group at the same time in the past.I've missed very few rehearsals for emotional reasons.I think there was like, you know a couple of a bunch that I missed when I was like dealing with Jonas and when oh, I didn't even miss that rehearsal the one wouldn't I like Corey and the day before I found out that he didn't like me back and I was like, oh God, I have to face him at rehearsal.I'm just going to play video games instead and then I ended up maybe being like 30 minutes late to rehearsal but still wentI haven't been this depressed.I mean, I guess it could but it could also hurt and I don't know which it'll be.I don't want to do that like because people have done that in the past and I don't want to be one of those people.Who does that?Yeah.Yeah, that's true.I guess it's also like freaking out on his nights like being able to get dinner before rehearsal and stuff.Especially, you know, now that I don't have anyone making me dinner anymore being able to do that all myself.I guess I'm also afraid that like, you know now I'm starting to feel like older than all the people in the group and if that's going to be an issue right now if I come back I wouldn't be the oldest member of the group.Well, you know, it would be a college acapella group, you know, like at a certain point like, you know, if I was like, you know 35 and people are looking very teen like you look weird Travis older person in this group.That's presumably college students or college students and grad students.No, so I guess it's not an issue.Now.We actually did have someone else who is older.So he left after a year because he was involved in like a stuff.And I think it was I don't know if he's going to come back to the group.So if he came back I wouldn't be the oldest one anymore.I know sometimes we worry about like not have enough undergrads for getting funding and being classified as a certain type of Stanford group, but they don't want to kick out grad students either just more like recruiting.I guess it's the depression is what stops me to anxiety.It's just hard to make all the right choices because it's so easy to like, you know, just sleep in like, you know Ethan on Monday morning.I had my game like the alarm went off and we had like more time that we could sleep and I wanted to go back to sleep because I knew that if I stayed up for a certain amount of time the tightness would come back and then it did you know, and then sleep seems like the only escape from it and I can't sleep all the time.But I choose lie, so I don't really know how to do anything.My whole life is falling apart.Yeah.I guess probably going to music rehearsal on Sunday night.Well, though just a part of me now thinks I'm making a huge mistake by wanting to join music again.I don't know if that's the depressed part of me or the sensible part of me.I guess I'm so reluctant to do it now, and I don't know.Yeah.Okay.It's like a little bit there.Yeah, like it's not as bad as it's like been the past few days.Yeah.So what do I have the moment when I can't calm down and can't make the tightness go away.truebut sometimes not until I go to sleepAnd then sometimes it will come back as soon as I wake up.I guess it's been so long that I can deal with that feeling it like drives me crazy half the time.I like really just want it gone any way possible.I have a heating pad.Of course, I wouldn't know where it is.I think it's one of the boxes that I haven't gone into yet.Okay.Okay.Yeah, can I borrow a pen so I can write you a check?00 cover purpleOf course every time I write the day today, I'm tempted to put my birth year as the year, but it's not 1985.It is 2014.Yes, I need to catch my breath post office downstairs is awfully cranky.I got here early.No, the US Post Office.I got here a little bit early because I had a package to mail to a friend in the UK one was ridiculously long and the forms were Olmec stop and not labeled labeled with the name of the form.I finally found the Forum that said customs declaration.I spent time filling it out while people behind me skipped me and lying to go ahead while I was writing.I finally get to the table and the guy is like is this the wrong form?I was like, okay, what form do I need to go back and get the Customs form?It says Customs form.Well, that's the Customs form for packages over 16 oz well, it doesn't say that on the form and I didn't know and then he made me go get back in the back of the line.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.I don't know.I don't know.I'm tired and cranky and not feeling well.and physicallyYeah, I've had a headache all day, but it's been resistant to painkillers both over-the-counter and prescription.Dave and I have been fighting a lot the last couple of days.I've been feeling really low and mood has been lower the past week and a half to two weeks than it has been in quite a while.I told him I was feeling low and that I was just really upset about a lot of things and I've been having his meltdowns at the end of the day.We're almost like a little kid having a meltdown.It's just that they're too tired and they need to go to sleep.But they refused to it's the same sort of completely losing all grip on reality and feeling like everything is overwhelming and I can't do anything.I know those are really stressful for Dave to witness.I really try to keep them bottled up and not expose him to it, but I don't know.I've been tired of having this shaky Edge on my self-control the last week or so.Anyway, I told him I was feeling really bad and I was really upset about the whole insomnia situation and that it's not getting any better.I have so much trouble getting to sleep staying asleep.It's just I can't sleep ever.I'll be completely exhausted at work at my desk falling asleep or sitting at home in my home study or on the couch not enough as soon as I get to bed.I'm wide awake and I can't get to sleep.It's really frustrating.Until 2 or 3 in the morning.Usually between 11 and midnight.I eventually conk out.No, I usually wake up two or three times a night.Depending on how much ice.Depending on how much sleep I've gotten and how much willpower I have between 7 and 8.Yep.Ambien doesn't work.I was trying to Ambien, but it just doesn't knock me out.I tried trazodone which is an antidepressant not and hypnotic what it does.Yes, and the problem with that is even at the smallest doses 1/4 of the smallest tab that is manufactured.It will knock me out, but then I'll sleep for 10 hours and feel hungover when I wake up.I have the same problem with Benadryl.No.yearsYep on weekends, like generally Saturday mornings.I'll just not turn on the alarm and I'll sleep and get 10 or 12 hours.Wake up at 10:30 or 11.Yeah, I don't know how I could get my sleep cycle to move earlier.It should be a simple thing because I'm waking up between 7 and 8 you would think I would just fall asleep after 16 hours of being awake, but no.I don't have a name.I saw a doctor Morgan, but I didn't like him at all.I missed an appointment because I screwed up my calendar and I was too embarrassed to call and tell him that I recorded it wrong.Then time went by and I got increasingly too embarrassed to call and asked to reschedule.Yeah, that was in October.He prescribed nothing.He said that they sell the notes that he got for my previous psychiatrist myself reported symptoms.He didn't think I needed antidepressants anymore.You wrote me a script for Ativan used as anto use on an as-needed basisand I haven't run out that script yet because I haven't actually felt the need for it.He said he wanted to check in again in six weeks.So we did and he said sounds good.Nothing has changed.Let's check in again in six weeks and that's the appointment I missed.Yes.She was the one who told me to do, Benadryl.She got really aggressive about monitoring my sleep hygiene and telling me I had terrible sleep hygiene and to do better and he's sleep problems would just go away if I followed the rules better.Nope.I had not.I haven't tried Lunesta either that's an option.Yes.Yep.Yeah.But yeah, I was telling Dave I was really frustrated that I couldn't get to sleep because this is so stupid.He woke me up less than an hour after I finally dropped off to ask me to move over cuz I was taking up too much space in the bed and then I did not get back to sleep at all that night you woke me up at 5 and then I was just up I couldn't get back to bed when he finally rolled out of bed at 8:30.I was like that was totally unfair don't ever do that again.I know it's not fair to you if I take up more space on the bed and maybe you have to go sleep on the couch and that's not fair, but I need to be able to sleep and I so much trouble sleeping.You just went off at me and yelled at me about how I wasn't doing anything about my sleep problems.And he had told me to try vitamin D because that would fix my sleep problem.And why wasn't I better?Is vitamin D suggestion is something that he pulled off the fucking internet.It's not something that came from a doctor and the number of bullshit snake oil fix your life remedies the Davis tried because some of the Quantified Self people did it on themselves.Are you familiar with this phenomenon of the Quantified Self?There's a trend among a certain type of tacky people the medical industrial complex is bullshit and doesn't know anything and you can't trust doctors or medical professionals.The only thing you can trust is yourself because no one knows your body as well as you do so they do experiments on themselves, untested uncontrolled unscientific experiments and then write blog posts about it.We try each other's ideas for how to lose weight and build muscle and develop chest hair and sleep well and lower your cholesterol by taking 6000 IU of vitamin E.Twist, and I agree with some of the underlined arguments that the medical industrial complex is way too industrialized and big Pharma kind of sucks.doctors were over scheduled and will only see you for 10 minutes really don't know as much about your body as you do becauseRight, so they started yelling that I didn't want to try this vitamin D thing and I was like, well, you're suggesting that I take something like 12 times FDA recommended allowance of vitamin D.A lot of these things.I just read a study about a month ago about how Vitamin C in the doses that people take to fight off winter colds.Like 10,000 IU is actually toxic to your liver.So I really don't want to take 12 times FDA recommended vitamin without medical supervision.He got really mad at me about that.Then a few days later.I told him that I was feeling bad enough that I was worried for my safety.I was afraid I would hurt myself.You just started yelling at me again.He told me I was selfish and I wasn't thinking about his feelings and he wish that he could believe that I loved him, but he can't because if I did I wouldn't be thinking about suicide and it would destroy his world.What if I attempted suicide and failed then I would be mentally disabled like his brother and you really want to be like my brother.Do you really want to have that level of mental reasoning?Yeah, things have been rough with me and Dave and I don't know what to do about it because I know living with me isn't easy.I'm a pain in the ass to live with in some regards.He kind of has a point.About it selfish with me to kind of dumped all my internal Chaos on him and not provide better buffering and to rely on him as much as I do not sustainable and not fair to him.Maybe this is the sort of thing that we should just see a couples counselor together about.It drives me crazy.He won't tell me what he's feeling.I'll ask him.Can we talk about how you're feeling?I don't want to right now.Okay, can we set a time to talk?I don't want to spend well, when can we talk?You ask me on the spur of the moment?I haven't had time to put my thoughts together.I can ask you now and I'm going to come back in an hour.Can you put your thoughts together by then and then he won't he claims that he doesn't need to see a therapist to he's had a relationship with his doctor since 2005.He sees him once every three months and it's mostly just to prescribe meds.He has ADHD.So he takes Concerta which is one of those drugs for you kind of have to go see a physician in person every 3 months because of FDA regulations.He also does psychoanalysis therapy sort of stuff?He's not just a prescriber, but Dave refuses to go in for therapy to talk about some of the stuff.He won't tell me how he's feeling until he blows up at me and accuses me of not loving him.It's really frustrating.Yeah.Yep.Not close enough to actually be contemplating making plans.Yeah.Yeah.I'm really tired of this particular song and dance.fighting off suicidal urgesThe first time I wanted to kill myself, I was 11.I ate a pack of my parents cigarettes.It was not a very pleasant plan.They made me throw up.Nope.I was really isolated throughout my entire childhood.I had no friends at all.I was tormented at school tormented at home, butEven at my happiest in the last 10 years or so.There's always been a thought in the back of my head at things are good now but don't expect them to stay good.You can always kill yourself tomorrow if they stopping good.What's that saying from The Princess Bride?I'll kill you tomorrow.Oh, I'll kill you in the morning.Yeah.I mean, sometimes it's been the kind of Downer.This is your jerk Cloud on a sunny day.And sometimes it's been literally the only thing that's kept me from doing something right now.Right.I can always change my mind about living tomorrow.I'm kind of sick of having that thought always in my head.Yeah, but I feel like it's always a really really hard time.There's no founding to that.It's an endless hard time.I'm not sure.Yes, it was actually last winter.It was why I fired my previous therapist.Yeah, I probably told you all about it.There was a lot that I didn't like about the treatment plan that she had of the straw that broke.The camel's back was that I had been wanting to kill myself the point where I was hoarding pills and I got scared and have to ask Dave to come home.I take them and hide them she completely blew that off and redirected the conversation talking about my dad and why he is the way he is kind of armchair diagnosing him from a distance, which I certainly don't have enough insight into what's going on to provide enough symptoms forRight.Maybe he does have PTSD that's quite likely given his history, but there is nothing I can do about that.I have a strongly develops instinct to mask.Yep.I'm also worried that if I let other people know just how bad things are.It will use that to take advantage of me.There's The Chronic NeverEnding stresses my parents which waxes and wanes is that again waxing and waning but never fully going away.I have anxiety around friendships and do people actually want me around and what is my value and all of that?May 15th through 27thWe have to get these nuts for this trip to China and my dad won't make up his mind whether he wants to deal with getting visas for everyone or whether he wants me and Dave to get her own.I emailed him to stay the trip is in 4 months.We need to get our visas.Do you want me to mail your passport and visa application so you can get everyone to be says he replied with a big incoherent rambling.I replied back and said just tell me either way, but we need to know I cc'd my sister because my sister has been pretty much the only person in my family and I include myself in this criticism was capable of dealing with Logistics and keeping track of things and staying organized.She sent me this really nasty email back saying, I don't know why this is such a big deal for you whether you send them to the travel agent or whether dad sends them.Why do you care stop bugging.Stop using email?You should call and talk to him.I was like a I hate using the phone having.Are you on the phone in the best of cases?I have a hard time understanding my dad because he mumbles see an email at least has a record of what is said that has a hard time understanding me because I don't know.He says my English isn't clear enough for him that I talk too fast and use too many big words, even though I make every effort when I'm talking to him to speak slowly and clearlyMy dad makes a big deal of his not being a native English speaker, even though he learned English when he was 8 years old and has been speaking it since then and speaks fluently.I think he just uses it as an excuse, but with the written word, you can read it if you don't understand and there's no wall.Also it matters because I don't want to just send a passport to travel agent.I need a booking code or something so that the travel agent knows who these passports are for.I ended up reading the whole log of items and emails between my family and myself about the stupid fucking trip and I didn't realize until I read them all together and every single regard about the Lightning Thief and disrespectful and dishonest with me.It's not about looking dates that I didn't want to go.It was also.Dad emailed me and said the travel agency offers flights to China from La Boston or Chicago.The default is LA and you have to pay more to go from Chicago or Boston.What did David I want he gave us a table prices.I said why don't you book a straight from Boston because the surcharge from the travel agency is less than the cost of a plane ticket from Boston to LA and summary.Please book us from Boston.Your license says we will see from La you can call the travel agent.If you want to go from Boston I said, but you asked me and I said book from Boston.He was like, we don't know your schedule.Your booking a strep.The schedule is determined by the flight from LA.I was like, okay fine.We'll book the fucking flight from Boston to La give me the contact info for the travel agent.He didn't send it.There were three emails in a row from me to Dad saying give me the info for the travel agent so I can book us from Boston to LA.Finally, he said it's such and such travel agency.Don't something I don't remember now.He gave me the name of the travel agency.I was like, okay fine and he said no no, we'll do the add-on since you don't want to pay for it.I was like, it's not the money.It's not being able to have that name and the information to call.He was like, you don't have to go to the travel agency.Why don't you just booked a ticket on the internet from Boston to LA?I was like, okay, what time does our flight from LA to part?I don't know.Why do you want to know that?Sorry, I got going.I hate my parents.That's all.It would have to be a morning because of scheduling with work and leaving early.Good morning.that session actually started with a recount of what's going on why we're here, you know as it might reasonably start withI guess how we got there isn't really the issue.But at some point Tanya disclose that she was still suicidal on a regular basis like multiple times a week.I suggested that that have been true for that.It had never not been true.You know, it sounds ridiculous.But I think I don't think she's correct about that.I think there was a.Of time where it certainly was not every couple or three days or something.I'm not sure that's really the important point though.I don't know exactly what to say about that other than that happened.SoYeah, I mean I've been living with her for a while.You know on the one hand, I'm not surprised in the context of the last several weeks.I think I mentioned that I had.I think I mentioned that I thought she had not been doing that.Well while I was gone.I mean that's not such big of a surprise they claim that it's like an unbroken string back to March or whatever.I'm not sure it really matters, butI think I feel like I should have a general sense of that and often I do without her saying anyting just living with her.I guess I also feel likeyou're not telling me is a sign of her not trusting me to do something or handle something just is what it is.Yeah, or it could be she suggested that she thought she told me or that I knew I'm not really sure that that's not reasonable.But yeah, I don't know.I sure sound discouraged don't I?Yeah talking about it's making me feel discouraged or at least it's that the emotion that's bubbling up.Yeah, I think probably that sounds about right.This incentive like here we go again.Yeah, I think on any particular day when she's not well I can either handle it just fine or I feel like there's nothing in that we're going to do today.That's any different from the last time we did exactly the same day and nothing's changed.SoRealistically, I think she's coping with it better in the sense that if the claim is true.She's been off and on suicidal for several months without being hospitalized.So that's probably good.Certainly, her mood has not been as dire as it has been in most of the hospitalization circumstances cuz it's obvious when her mood is that bad?Yeah, I think discouraged.It's right.I don't have a very clear sense of here's a strategy that will win out in the end.Just keep doing this.I'll come here.She'll see Josh.Go to couples counseling.She'll still be suicidal.Yeah, I think discouraged is right.fair enoughI would just say that was a really good thing to say.Yeah, I think it's right there are two fairly obvious and points that.None of which is ideal necessary.But this is the real world.Whatever.yeah, and the pasta neither is necessarily smooth or happy butYeah, I want the framing that you gave because it so that's not really an option in the original setup.Right?You said eventually you will feel okay in one of these two set.I thought you framed the entire thing very very carefully and there was a whole lot packed into it and I liked it.Yeah, there was a great deal about acceptance and lost built into the two paths.circling aroundrepeating what you said sort of so it was very freeing to hear the first time.You know, something's just rang very very true.And that was one of them.Like I said, it was very well trained and I'm just yeah, those are the I don't know points in the distance and some cents.So then I think something like that and how it's helpful and free and then I think about the question or the it will occur to me that that was the right thing to say if such a thing exists.So then it's well, how did you know it was the right thing to say right then then I will think about this moment when you asked me what are you thinking about?And I say thatand then you would usually then respond something like you wonder how I came to this and I said, yes and then we talk about something else.That's our pattern.And then I try to think about the other things since that's not going to go anywhere.It's so I want to think about something else.Yeah, I think I'd like uncertainty to be bounded and I think that's more or less the correct bounding on uncertainty.I certainly don't know where we'll end up or where I will end up.But yeah, the space is marked in some way or something.So I'm going to a conference next week and making a poster.I finished the poster last night.Making process is so exciting to sing for me because I don't like making mistakes and I don't like correcting it in large letters when there are mistakes.So I'm very careful not to make mistakes, but there's also like oh, I don't know some not well defined apprehension about the experience of presenting the poster.So one of the main ways I combat guys to think about the other conference that I went to where the things I was talking about.I was not particularly pleased with the work.I mean, I was pleased when they got to the point they had gotten toBut like it was mostly the things we were trying really don't work and they don't work for these reasons.What is a vaguely depressing experience very depressing experience, but big least satisfying to be able to bury it in that way.But I found that it was well-received experience was vaguely awkward because you don't know anybody but it's fine.So I can fairly well predict what it's going to be like even though I've never been to this particular conference.I guess I'm am used to have you do the same thing that I would do if I were trying to manage the emotion or deal with it or something.It was nice althoughAnd then I hadn't really, you know, we get to this point to the sessions and they have been sort of randomly distributed across sessions and in the time-space of a session break one of us will get on something true.Usually it's you will refer formulate everything into a concise whole very nicely and then I don't have much more to say then yes.Strangely comfort and joy, like delighted by the process that we went through there.I find it amusing that that was how it went.But I'm also really pleased that that was very nice and I really appreciate you doing what you do and saying what you said.Yeah, I think it's comforting to have the problem understood thoroughly and the long-range answer to it described in careful detail.You're not painting Rosie pictures and any sense, but other pictures where things are.Okay, and they'll descriptions were how to get there in a long-term scale sense.I think how does that make me feel so that I can sort of dwell on what it might look like to go along the path, you know to think about the intervening time between here and there and where everything either stands a beam and none of it isAnd I know that it had sorrow and hardship and all of that attached.But yeah, it's okay because it's going somewhere.Yeah, yeah.Was that meant as a recommendation?Yeah.Yeah, I guess the question is something like was that a more prescriptive or more a descriptive statement that it would be really nice for me to feel things that are good even if not ideal.Okay, okay.Okay.Yeah, yeah.Some people often use they describe situations as non-ideal that are really bad.Do you mean those alsoYeah, so you you suggested that you would want for me to feel good about situations that are not ideal.Is the non ideal intentionally unbounded there?Because look.No, I hadn't appreciated having that quick Insight.I think.I think that's a hard problem.Yeah, we dealt with this in several different conversations.Also in the sense that like this is definitely related to the of something in the sense thatWe're all going to die.What does ideal even mean in that context?Or bounded in the vastness of time and space and what sense does a small concept of Ideal?How does that fit their?But I think I normally make a distinction between ideal and like some range of okay and then some other range of really not.Okay.So likethen I guess I don't know.I'm not sure.It's a yeah, I guess I need some argumentation that it is a reasonable task to try to get rid of the category of not.Okay.Like I don't really think you would argue with that, you know using chemical weapons in Syria was a good thing or an okay thing.No, I didn't really take you to be but that was what I was asking you if you left.not ideal unboundedAlthough the bottom floor not ideal is really bad.You may be right you listen to me and you listen very very well.In some circumstances.I feel like I'm drawing a line where this is.Okay, and this is not okay like any use of chemical warfare not okay.but then I might say something as ideally in order to use chemical weapons, which I don't think you really disagree with butNo, that's okay.Thanks very much.Okay.It'll go fine.Bye.I'm feeling pretty proud of myself right now.I woke up this morning and I was really not doing well.I slept 2 hours later than I meant to because I wake up and I'd be like I can't get up.I can't do this and then go back to bed and set my alarm for another half an hour.I'm sure James really likes that he's pretty good about it.I couldn't get started.I was wanting to hurt myself and was doing really bad.I kind of sat there and thought well, my therapist would probably say that this was something about feeling this way sucks, but it's millier.So it kind of comfort for me.I don't know about that.I thought well, it is comfortable in the sense that as long as I am incapacitated like this.I don't have to figure out what to do next.I can kind ofI can say kind of this isn't really my fault.I don't have to think.Okay.What do I do?If I don't have a job?I don't have to actually solve the problem.I was thinking about anything else.That was all I've been thinking about for the last couple of days.I thought okay, and then I felt better.Yeah, go figure.Yeah, the problem I have is that now I have basically a month of waiting because I've applied to all of the positions.There aren't going to be very many positions being posted because most schools do their contract renewal somewhere around spring break or earlier like in February or early March and so they post new openings in February or March.I've applied for basically all of the positions that I would be a good fit for and are ones that I want to apply for.about 20 I think yeah, people will have last-minute positions open, but those are going to be far and few betweenusually what happens as far as I can tell is the hiring committee meet sometime in late March or early April figure out who they want to interview and then call those people.So now I basically have to sit for the next month and see if anybody calls me.So that's going to be hard.Oh, yeah.I have pretty much the same conversation with James once a week where I'm so anxious that I'm like well maybe I should just drop this all together and look at other fields, like look for a different job altogether James always says well if you take a full-time job, you won't be able to teach next year.If you get a call you won't be able to take it.You can't do it.I think my job for at least the next month is kind of to keep my anxiety under control.Which you know, that's kind of a full-time job.Too bad.I don't get paid for that.Yeah.I feel like I'm getting better at it though.Yeah, it's like the last couple of days it kept getting worse and worse.And worse but I also kept feeling like I just needed something to snap me out of it and I wasn't able to find that.Yeah.I'm sure there is more to it.Then.I suddenly felt better.But that's kind of what it felt like.I think it was that I hadn't looked at it that way and then said, okay.Well, that's the case then.I mean, I don't know whether that's true or not.But if I act like that's true, then the next thing for me to do is figure out what I'm going to do next and say book.No, I actually have to figure out what I have to do next.But I talked to James again and said no, I pretty much just have to keep doing the same thing.It's not time for me to decide that I failed at this yet.Give it another month then we'll decide on it together.Yeah, ya know it's likeNow I just get to be anxious hooray.I read an article a friend of mine writes about he basically writes about culture for a lot of little magazines and I did desus and he's a very good writer W. Like I wrote this and I'll read it.He wrote about a show that I've never seen girls which apparently is a Big Show and the reading it I was like, it's just like sex in the city and Gossip Girl only better.I was like, okay.I really don't want to see the show now.Not really my thing.He was talking about anxiety and describing having a panic attack the other night.I think he ended on was he said anxiety tends to Cripple us and keep us in her harness and keep us from relating to people and he was from looking outside ourselves, but it can also be this thing that spreads to connect with other people and to write to figure things out.I kind of had to look back through the rest of the article because I was like, I don't see the second part at all.I don't find that anxiety.Does that for me?I think what he was saying is that he saw his connection to the anxiety of the character on the show and it spurred him to write that article.Anyway, I don't know.I feel like my depression and anxiety just makes me worse person consistently.certainly more selfish personI reread the end of the affair yesterday.I told my sister that's what I was reading.And she said are you sure that's a good book for you to be reading when you're having a bad day?It's Graham Greene.I've read it before but I forgotten everything about it.It's about this man who had an affair with this woman.It's set just post World War II in London.if they're mostly took place during the war, she broke it off with him completely unexpectedly a year-and-a-half ago and he's basically been greeting her existence ever sinceThe terrible person so he's super jealous of her and hates her and takes her husband is hiring a private detective to track her because he thinks she's sleeping with somebody else now.I forgotten that it's essentially a book about God Graham Greene was a convert to Catholicism.I picked it up because I was reading a biography of for American Catholic writers.It's a really good book.Anyway, it's about God and it's about suffering.It's pretty theological as it turns out.It's about God as both a suffering God and someone who's with you and your suffering kind of the Redemptive qualities of suffering.So it's like okay not seeing this.I know it's Easter.So that's basically all we're going to be talking about for the next six weeks the suffering God basically the Theology of suffering.Yes.Yes, if you believe Jesus Is God what does it mean to have a God who suffers with you etcetera that turns into you.There are a lot of really terrible field agents out there.Every priest has to give a sermon every Parish Priest.Some people are really good at sermons and some people are really not good at them.I'm both picky and kind of skeptical about things.I feel like one of sermons are good.So anyway, a lot of people end up talking about suffering as something that is a good thing or it sure sounds like they're talking about suffering as a good thing.Maybe they're not trying to say that but that's what they end up saying by accident.I don't really feel like this is done me any good.Yeah, yeah.Partly because it sucks to be misunderstood and partly.I'm just like why am I doing this wrong?Yeah sermons in general tend to piss me off to be honest.Yeah, you know I really like going to church in some ways.I've no idea why I actually believe and it's still very you don't find very many priests were comfortable admitting that they don't know.We're comfortable talking about things that they don't know.You got a lot of complacent certainty.It is difficult for me toDeal with even when I'm not depressed.It's always difficult for me to deal with.My sister is the same way actually which is funny because she works at church.She forms people form young Christians.She's getting confirmed which is like you get baptized as an infant and then at least in Episcopalian and I think in Catholicism and I'm sure in some other religions, but you get confirmed as a young adult is like entering into an adult relationship with the church and saying I affirm these things this is who I want to be and this is where I want to beDo usually get confirmed when you're like 13 not when he cheats the confirmation class.When she was in 8th grade, she went through it through the confirmation class because you know, you're the priest kid and my dad taught it and then she said I'm not getting confirmed.I don't believe I'm not doing it.I think my dad was not super happy about that.I think she pretty much past due now.Sorry.I was wonderingyeah.Usually I'm pretty comfortable being mad and critical at the sermons.I have been kind of the skeptic in the feudal for a long time.But on this topic, I'm anxious about it.I would really like this to mean something but I just don't think it does.I guess I feel like we talked a lot about how this works how it happens and the first kind of meeting what triggers it how it plays out.I guess I'm talking more about why is this happening to me?Why is this my life?I guess it's got to be the question everybody asks, and so I guess it makes me angry to hear people offer answers that are to me clearly not the case.I hear a lot of suffering will bring you closer to God and I hear a lot of suffering will help you be a better person understand other people better or be closer to other people.I don't feel like either those are the case.I feel like I just get more and more alone and less and less capable of seeing anything outside of myself.But that doesn't have to be the case for everybody.I don't know you're going there or not.Yeah, I very often do you like when I'm doing badly and I talk to somebody about it at the end of it.I sort of feel like great now.We're both unhappy awesome.Yeah, particularly when the last couple of days there's nothing really new to say it's pretty much the same thing happening.It kind of happens over and over and over.Yeah, I feel like James gets frustrated with me about that or I worry about that.I feel like well if my life sucks, at least it should suck a new way.Or if it sucks in the same way I should be able to come up with something to do about it.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.No, it's okay.I talked to my sister on the phone yesterday and I was doing pretty badly.She was having a good day.I didn't want to go into too much detail about not doing well because then I start crying on the phone and all of those things.Where I was going with this is that from me when I'm with somebody when I'm suffering.I can't think about the other person at all.I can't enter the other person's life.I can't talk about the things that the other person wants to talk about.It's like I don't have anything to give that sucks.I feel terrible about that.We talked for a little bit and she told me all about what was going on with her and then there was just silence.I told her what was going on and that I was having a bad day and that I was anxious about finding a job and haven't heard back from anywhere etcetera Etc.But to try to summarize why I'm not doing well takes about 30 seconds.And then I just have the same things to say over and over and over again.That's all I've got.It's like this huge giant thing for me that's blocking out everything else.Oh, yeah, that's a lot more and to think that I'm having a bad day.Yeah.No, I was just going to agree with you.That is interesting.After we talked about jobs and what to do what I should be doing for the next month.She said let's not wait another week and a half before we had this conversation because he just do four days and then we talked about it.Let's just talk about it before you starts doing that's an idea.I'm worried about trying your patience.A lot more about trying James's patience.Yeah, I don't know why it doesn't occur to me.I don't know.We always have these weird conversations.Like hey, how are you doing?I'm not doing so well.I'm kind of having a bad day.How are you doing?She talks for 15 minutes about her dog.It's like I'm pretty good at keeping the focus off of myself and then feel kind of resentful about it, which doesn't help.I don't know.It's like we can either have the conversation about me or we can have the conversation about her.It doesn't feel like both can happen in the same conversation.So I can either tell her what my life is actually like right now or in order to listen to her at all.I sort of have to pretend that the rest of my life doesn't exist.I have to pull out of it yesterday.I just couldn't do that.Yeah, I guess I also don't know what else to say to her because I told her how it is.I mean, she's somebody I really trust somebody.I'm really close to maybe it's too scary.Or I feel like if I tell her that she will have to deal with this too.And it's don't want that.I think that's it.I guess part of me is like I'd rather be alone in this than having other people hurting like this.But I also sort of want other people to be.With me so clearly part of me wants other people to feel like this and I feel bad about that.Somehow it doesn't occur to me.I'm not that good of a storyteller.You know, I'm not going to give this to other people by talking about it.Yes, if you look exactly like I will.Yeah clearly.Good morning.I had a good day yesterday.It was feeling like spring maybe one day.It's feeling like spring but you know good enough.So I took the kids out to the playground.And they started packing her me thinks that moving could be really good.I don't know.back to waiting and seeingI don't know enough what the options are.It occurred to me this morning that even if I had stayed at Brown and James had moved us here.We would still be in this position at this point where I really didn't want to do a postdoc.So I guess it's a little bit reassuring.It would still be tough right now.We are supposed to go to this party with most of James's friends grad school were in the Denver area this weekend.Our car is still not running.So I don't know.I think there's a commuter rail we can take but it's like an hour's Drive Away by the commuter rail.Outwest.It's way out west onto I don't know.I don't know but I did find out that Monica only wants me to come in for a couple 3 hours on Friday if that so that would be nice.I have a tough time with the people from James is grad school program.It's just always sort of stressful.I like them.They're fine.We're just really different from me.Then I think well, they're also really different from James.I don't know.I think that was one of the things that was tough for James in Ohio get trouble finding people to talk to which is why it was so great.When his friend from undergrad Tony and his wife Carrie were there because Cody is a poet he could talk to him.How do you sort of crazy in some ways I can never tell whether he believes ideas.He's putting out there or whether it's more that he thinks the world would be more fun if it were true.And so he's just sort of hoping that they're true.I don't know.I don't much easier time finding friends than James does and I don't know whether that's because I am I don't know better at finding people or less picky about the people that I want to be friends with or whether it's because I'm just positioned right in a way that James is notI don't know if the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in chemistry are all that different from the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in theology.It's not a difference.What I don't know if we did move.This will be the first time that I moved to a new city where I didn't know anybody or didn't know more than a couple of people and wasn't already in some sort of graduate program or workplace or something to Anchor me.It doesn't make me anxious, but I feel like maybe it ought to.I think that that could go really badly, but I can't get worried about that.I don't know.Even with knowing so many people it hasn't really kept me from being really lonely here.It's a weird thing one day.I'll be talking to James about it or thinking about it and be like yeah.Yeah, let's go somewhere else.Let's find a new place and see what the options are.There's almost no where else in the country where my skills would be less valuable than they are here in terms of there being a critical mass of people with a Humanities degree here.There are a lot of people who are brown educated in some of your discipline here just a lot of them and it's really fun.But it also means that finding a job is that much harder and that's not going to be the case in other places.I feel like there's almost no situation.That would not be better for James than what we were in now.It makes a huge difference in my life when he's doing.Well when I'm not the only person that he has to talk to about interesting.Things like this is for us.Some days, I think that and then other days is just like Terror yesterday was sort of the ladder and today is sort of the former and I don't know.obviously you coming to that but it's not clear to me howyeah.It's hard to make decisions across emotional states.I always wonder whether everyone is like this like the whole landscape changes on your having a bad day or when you're having a good day.I imagine if I think about it most things are spectrum and blah blah blah.I don't know.Thanks.Yeah, it's certainly not the case for James and it certainly like every once in a while.We'll have an explicit conversation about it.We're all say James.This is how I work when I'm having a good day.It looks really different than when I'm having a bad day.I can't see anything outside of my emotions.I think it makes things very confusing for him.It makes things very confusing for me also at times.Oh, well, I feel like if I can tell something and get other people to help remind me of that.Maybe it won't matter so much that I can't remember it myself.yeah I feel like the extent to which I have sort of changed that has been more like remembering that I lose touch and actually not losing touch and that's even not that greatso it's like in the last couple to three weeks even I'll be like in this awful place just totally miserable and desperate and kind of crazy making and then I go to do something usually with something for church and acts like I'm okay and after about a half-hour somebody will ask how are you doing and I'll be like Oh I'm great and it's not like I'm lying I believe it but it's just like at that moment I'm only thinking about the part of my life that is right here right now which means that I'm having an interesting conversation or I'm doing okaySometimes I feel like it helps me survive again helps me get through those really bad times.It's weird.I feel like it's impossible for me to be honest in some ways.If I say actually I'm not doing so well that is true with regards to the macro state, but it doesn't actually reflect what's going on in that moment.If I say I'm doing great and that reflects what's going on in the moment, but it's a very small moment compared to what's really happening.I wonder when people stop believing what I say.It was as pretty Facebook conversation last night about deaf children and Cochlear implants a bad choice and all of that.I don't know if it was talking like people clearly didn't know very many deaf people or weren't in touch with that Community because it was very why would you everNot give your child a chance to hear.That is an incredibly cruel and a terrible Choice.Yes language is culture and that would be bad if that were lost.But no really it's more important to be hearing.I don't know what I think about that but it's not really important.Joanne is a interpreter and she's really involved with the deaf community and used to teach primary school kids who are deaf.So she's pretty anti cochlear implant and pretty firmly an advocate for the deaf community.I was sort of seeing both sides of it and I guess I was just thinking about how you don't see what is outside your experience.People say why do parents choose not to give their children a chance of having a whole other sense?Well, they don't have it and they like their life and they don't know in some instances.They can't know what they're missing and also people who have that extra sense can't know what they're missing by having it.Yeah, and since it's about perception, it's been nice link to the conversation to be having.I was reading a poem called Monet refuses the operation.It was about the painter describing it took me 55 years to learn how to see like this and now you want to fix my eyes.What is a nice poem?I guess I was just thinking how it was relatively recent that it occurred to me that other people might not work like this like these so controlled by their emotional states like half the landscape be so dependent on emotions.Maybe everyone else is like that just in different ways and I don't know.I just feel like people who say their judgments are wholly dependent on their emotional state are mostly full of bullshit.My favorite Old Testament scholar gave a lecture on Saturday in the line.I really liked was up until about the mid-twentieth century scholarship was all about objectivity.And that was the gold standard of objectivity.and then we eventually just realized an objective it ewas just white male experience.That was nice.You would think that I was going somewhere butI know this is how Amanda works so that also makes it hard.She is much more polarity than I do in some ways.So I feel like sometimes I talk to her from time to time and it will be like she just has had this completely different idea of what her life looks like in one conversation then a week later.That I get but I feel like sometimes were just really far separated.So when we try to talk, I just don't know what she's saying at all.Sometimes we're really there together and sometimes we just can't even talk.Part of me wants to be like, is there a diagnosis for that and part of me is like I don't think it really matters that much.I don't know which of those I actually want to clean this my opinion.I feel like I know which of those you would fall on butt.Your approach tends to be like I don't think that matters all that much.It's funny talking with people in the hospital people get very attached their diagnosis.I think I only noticed that because I don't have one in the same way.I don't think I'm really expecting you to weigh in on this much.I feel like sometimes when I talk about stuff.I really want you to say something about it or speak from experience, but I don't really feel like that's the case right now.I think that depression is about as useful a description as fever in some ways.The one thing that I've been I've seen in talking to people who have a bipolar diagnosis, it is clear that that is a really useful thing for them to know about themselves.I was just thinking about Amanda.I feel like from where I said, it looks to me a lot like she is bipolar 2 and she doesn't want to be involved in mental Healthcare.Basically.She doesn't want to take meds and okay.I don't know.I wonder how her life would be different if she were not making that choice.Yes, I don't know if it would be better.It would be different.I think it might be better.She's had some really bad therapist.So I did soLike I don't swing by lently in this direction so much as I just saunter over there.In some ways.I feel like what I'm doing.Well, it's very common for me to want to be doing something else to be like I want to explore I want to go someplace else and see what else is out there.I also think it would be nice to be closer to family like it would be nice to be back in San Antonio.It's like I can remember other times when I was happy and the physical location of those times.So I guess that's less exploring and more like I want to go back there.I can't remember what it was like to live in San Antonio when I'm depressed because I remember that it's being really happy so it doesn'tI feel like it's less important for me to tell you about it when I'm doing better.Like when I sat A desperate I described it constantly inside my head if I'm really down.I'll often try to think how I would tell somebody about it.What would I say?I feel less urgent.Which is a little depressing in itself.I just think it's a little depressing and that what I feel is so urgent for me to put out in the world is all the worst stuff that happens that is inside me.The good things seem less important to spread around and I don't know.I don't really think I'm comfortable with that idea.I guess I also feel like everyone would understand what it feels like to be doing pretty well and enjoying my job.Yeah.I was talking to Camilla about how I was feeling pretty bad Sunday, and I said something I said.I think I said that I don't understand how Denver hasn't been swallowed up in earthquakes with how sad I feel she was like that really sucks.That was really pretty.Thanks.The thing is I feel so bad about putting things on people.I want to find a way to make it bearable for them.I know you are very helpful.Thank you for taking time to call me.So Ivan said he was fine that night that he didn't need to go anywhere and that so he didn't do anything further.He did say I was hoping you wouldn't find that so we did make the distinction that he was saving it actively.It wasn't something that he forgot about which I was really hoping it was because that's really common for him.But it wasn't and we saw dr. Farrow SP Friday.Obviously, it wasn't very helpful.And I guess I something I tried to convey to her which I'm not sure she understood not communicating directly.You are maybe she doesn't understand.I feel like I need more help.I feel like I need I don't know what she takes.I don't know what it should look like but it's been it's really become a lot to take care of him on some level and to be responsive to the way things are going with his depression and such without any additional help because I feel like it's really helpful to me with you, but that's 45 minutes out of the week.Then my sister is there always listening but I feel bad like putting that on her cuz then she's really worried.I don't like going I don't like doing that and that's kind of where it ends because my parents aren't so able I guess and talkin Ivan's dad was a really bad experience.So I guess she's like you need someone to come in and help you with the apartment.I'm like no.In theory, I think it would come from our sets of parents and Theory it would be someone who could be calling them and checking up and finding out what's going on and be really like I'm bored with this treatment plan and I don't know if I should call that but maybe for me somebody who's able to call and just how's it going?It seems pretty clear.It's not going to come for my parents, which is fine.And dr. Farrow said do not call his dad.I think it's more emotional support.I think it's more I'm having a really really tough time is mood swings seem to be more pronounced.Egos for my crying to really happy hyper attentive towards me you guys really back and forth back and forth, which I understand part of depression.I shouldn't expect it to be different.I'm not criticizing the fact that he's going through that but I'm just acknowledging its really tough.Right now I'm really worried about the threats in the note and I'm very worried about it obviously, but I'm also again it sounds horribly selfish.But I've taken a moment and realizing that this is really tough to deal with I'm not doing it completely alone obviously, but it feels like sometimes when I'm not when I'm not hereI'm the only other person in the apartment and it's too much and it's affecting me physically and it's affecting me emotionally and sometimes I feel myself being really pulled down in his when the moves are really impressive and it's really hard to like try to bring him up because I'm like, so it's getting really difficult to manage.I don't know.I've talked to my sister a little afterwards like the next couple days or whatever and I told her what had gone on and she's like, well, he's reacting like a dad.He's emotional.He can't it's unfortunate.He couldn't step out to help you but you felt like it went back to his he and Ivan are more friends than anything which is I don't know how I feel about that.But I mean he was not at all able to be it wasn't like an initial hysteria and then he calm down like he had a plan.No.He wasn't like stopping and but he was really emotional and he was very clear that he wanted me to talk or to call doctor bored and find out what I should be doing differently and how I should be taking care of it.He's like do not call and ask what I've been needs to be doing find out what you need to be doing.I'm sure he meant I'm sure it never occurred to him.That sounded really accusing but he said I don't know if this is around the time you went home to get your car inspected, but I don't know if I even if it sounded like you didn't want him to go.I want don't want to get in the middle of that.But so we just kind of let me know that he thought it was me kind of astounded accusatory to me and he called me back after a while cuz he couldn't wait to hear if I had gotten hold of dr. Word and he's telling me that Ivan has had some struggles with this before.He's like Ivan doesn't know it but he wrote a poem and 7th grade and his teacher called me because it was dark and I wanted to say why didn't you do anything?Why didn't you but all I said was I feel like it's clearly in grad school even a little before I haven't needed some help with this and you didn't get it.There are some big things.I'd like to know when really see his struggle with attention or memory or he's like no, that's all he's been here.Whenever I mention I said that.I said I said someone I didn't want to bring in that I'm seeing someone intimate but I said one of them said that it might be helpful for Ivan to get some kind of evaluation to find out what's going on and maybe even a pharmaceutical evaluation and just I told him I didn't know if he was aware but Ivan feels that this is very big matized and he's very disappointed in himself.If that would, you made that very clear.I said, I don't know if there's a way that you could somehow approach him and let him know that you guys support it and you don't you know, there is no Stigma and its healthy kids really couldn'tYou really couldn't get that maybe cuz I'm like, I know you told Ivan at one point he needs to be on antidepressants and I said maybe you don't do that.I said, you know, you're not really it's not really your field and even if it was you are his dad and you are so close to this.He's like, well, I did take a lot of psychology course.I'm just I'm sorry.I can't get past that.I'm so angry at him.He's a pastor.He went to Seminary like he's not major in Psychology event.He has no what is honestly on the phone telling me how 20 years he took a couple classes, and I'm just likehahaI know everybody's acting like nothing ever happened and Martin was very clear on the phone.He's like this conversation never happened and you till you hear from doctor.I don't think you should confront Ivan.I told him I didn't know what to do here.And I was hoping he really just kind of told me to just so is unfortunate and he kind of gave me like a short list of what he needed and he never called me back not even to check like how's it going?I think that's his way of so I understand Ivan maybe avoids him sometimes and maybe he'll learn that a little bit at home.I don't know.I'm just really.Maybe tell my sister said what about Julie?Maybe his mother is a bit more.She's definitely a bit more or less emotional unless mainly talking but the problem is I'm very intimidated by her.So I'm kind of scared to call and I'm really worried that I it can go as badly as it did with Ivan's dad or worse and I really again this sounds really selfish, but I really can't deal with her blaming me cuz I already feel like there is already suggesting me saying you need to have a job or you need to like that makes him feel worthless or that makes him feel which is difficult.No, no.I don't know.I really again I keep trying to emphasize the doctor Fair out cuz I feel like this has been really clearing me for a while.Is that I really need something more and it's not so she's like do you need to see my doctor McNally more?Do you need someone to help you clean the apartment?Do you need I don't know that those are and then she immediately from there went to separation which right now I don't feel good about and I don't want to do but I don't know if it's a parent.This is really difficult yesterday.I had to listen to him tell me how it's inevitable.We're going to get divorced and couples therapy.I have to listen to him say this is hopeless.It's never going to get any better and I have to find a way to not only get upset and not have any emotions surrounding that and not take a minute to go cry or call someone or take care of myself.I need to turn around and say like what can we do to help you tell me it's really difficult.Yes.I'm tired, and I don't know what doctor Pharaoh says.She thought it seemed like she perceived me as being almost like stuck in the 90s.Like I'm really doing it all over and it feels that way to an extent but honest to goodness it more.Maybe this is just me not being aware of but it really feels like I really do did do it growing up and I really did do it even in college like every summer and now I really am doing it with my spouse and soShould I try to talk to Julie?Is that a?My mom is apparently still not talking to me for two weeks ago when I asked about Easter, so I am not sometimes she can be really helpful and other times around like she's really not not a good situation and my dad doesn't do any type of emotional discussion.You would tell me I'm really sorry to hear that.Let me know if there's anything I can do you would care to talk about feelings is not something he does and he would really take the you know, I'm really cross that Ivan didn't get a job or he needs to be working you and take the very practical like you someone who doesn't take care of his own house.So I mean he's worried about me.If anything.He's pretty disappointed.I think with the way Ivan has been.I don't know, but I'mNo, no, I'm not expecting a sex but what I'm saying is that I feel pretty overwhelmed and everyday truly yesterday.You went from crap all the way through church afterwards telling me how we're getting a divorce then at lunch like nothing ever happened happy and then later in the evening like crying a little bit again and then up and down and then up again and it is so sharp and it's so actually doing and I can't I can't even tell him this is going on or that I'm struggling at this because he's totally unaware.He's in his own.He's also doing a little bit of it feels pretty manipulative and my sister said that sounds really intentional.I don't know but she's doing things like a walk time 4:30 a.m.Shift at Starbucks and I'm like, why would you do that?Like that doesn't even make sense to take the car.That's so silly.It's a 10 minute drive.Why would you even though no pity party so upset about it?And of course I kept saying no, of course not I feel like those comments are meant to elicit a lot of sympathy.What should I do?And then the next night when it wasPlay snowing is it okay if I take the car tomorrow morning?He's really doing that alot.It's happening another I can go without health insurance for a couple months until it kicks in.I'm like, why are we even going to have this conversation?It's so absurd and he knows it's absurd and I feel it's very clear that he denies.He's like, I'm not manipulating you I'm not trying to get any kind of sympathy but he'll throw pity party like like I don't need health insurance.I can walk like really extreme and of course I respond very warmly lovingly sympathetically and he wants that and it's really frustrating because again, I feel really alone and taking care of all this and it is a lot all day every day and night still breaking out in hives in the whole thing.It's impossible.I don't think anyone gets what's going on?Because quite honestly he sits in a couples therapy and says I can take care of myself.I've got it under control and then dr. Farrell turns to me and says you need to start taking him at his word.No understand.Then when we go home and Ivan continues to say that you can take care of himself sometimes but he's not taking care of himself.Like you didn't have a schedule for this week.You didn't and I'm like, okay you need to call this morning and you need to get that.I can't I can't that's like the bear him do the word think that is embarrassing.I need to have happen from him right now.I need to be able to get groceries.I need to be able to pay the bills.I don't know.I mean we had a pretty big fight before he would call for it for his very first week.Like something is really seriously wrong when someone doesn't care if they have their work schedule.After a month of not having a job.You just keep saying I don't want that.I don't need that.I don't want that.I don't need that.No one is there to see that?He can't do it on his own.Remind me Tuesday morning.I woke up and we had warm food because he couldn't remember to close the fridge.I mean we woke up in the car battery was dead because he couldn't remember to turn off the light.I mean he's been using shampoo to wash his body for over a month because he can't remember to take his new bar of soap into the shower.I mean things actually happen that affect me so it's not like we've been down the road I can let it go or said I should let it go and it just falls on him and maybe he'll learn consequences the whole it doesn't happen.He doesn't get worked up about the consequences I do and they affect me too.It can't happen.I don't dr. Ferro try to say something like that.She got creative.I don't know if I don't mean to say you're not aware, but I can't just move in with my sister.She has a one-room like studio type thing on the top floor of a house and they don't turn on the heat and I have a cat and I go to school and she lives in Newton and I have stuff and I would have to be on their list.There is now it would involve one of us finding another place.Probably unless I live with my sister and there is now I don't think anyone is scaring me.Like I need him to get the schedule because I need him to be able to pay our rent if you don't have money for another.Okay.It's really hard.I feel like she doesn't get it.I feel like she blames me.She criticizes me and I feel like she says we need to deal with your anger and resentment and that we never talked about Ivan's depression.I feel like she tries to counselors like we are both.I don't know how to say this.I feel like she tries to counselors like Ivan isn't depressed and having mood swings and having problems with memory things like that never enters the room.I feel so it's like super callous because you can't expect the same result.I can't getdoesn't matter.What is not working?Because I've tried We have basically two rooms.We have the bedroom.We have the living room dining room.We have an open kitchen and the bathroom and the patio.I'm hoping that someone well, I don't know.All I know is I really need more help because it's really exhausting and really likeI need someone.You need to listen Maybe to stay at the end of the day say like oh your husband told you you're going to get a divorce.That's really.I'm sorry, this is so stupid.It's not that big of a deal.I'm just a little I guess I need to someone to say that's really difficult.I'm here for you.Just something or it must be really tough to listen to him.Say how hopeless it is and keep going but I'm here for you and I hear that and you're not crazy and you're not going to make it up and it's okay to get upset about that or you found a suicide note today.Oh my gosh, let me listen or let me come over and just hang out with you.I don't know something but frankly quite frankly.I have you and I have my sister and I'm even reluctant.I told her about the note and stuff which I didn't want to do, but I really need to have somebody.But like that's the best relationship.I haven't quite honestly, she's been my caretaker when she was young because she's the oldest and I hate that she ends up she goes and she's really worried about me and then she tries to help me out in ways, but I don't want our relationship to become all about trouble in my marriage because she already listens to my mom about her problems and her marriage and my poor sister is never going to get married and I don't know I need somebody toI know we talked about it for like 5 minutes and then she's like let's move on to where we left off and I'm like no you don't get it.I can't talk about any of our problems in here because he's going to go write another note was going to make another threat or Worse.He's going to continue finding ways to hide that you tried to tell him you need to tell doctor board about these things.You need to promise that and he's like no, I don't want to tell anyone because I shouldn't be feeling this way.I don't even say that.I'm angry when I'm angry because I should be better than that and it's obscure.It's likeI don't know.It's getting really really difficult and I don't.Cuz I want him I just can't do this anymore.Like I can't do this for five more seconds on the other hand.It's okay because I need to take care of him and he needs my help right now and he's my husband and he's really struggling but it's just like you won't get the help he needs.It doesn't matter.It doesn't even.I can't turn to my husband and say I'm having a really tough time with your mood swings.I can't do that.I can't say it really hurts me that you don't support me going to school.I can't do that.I can't.Going to get more depressed.I don't think anyone I can't talk about anything that's going on that's wrong with his behavior anything that hurts me because it sent him further in the shame and guilt and depression.What's a horrible about that?No, it really does become my problem because I need to take care of him when he's writing notes and making threats and sobbing your church because we're going to get a divorce.and who's going toAm I have no marriage last?I have no Ivan is things are going to get worse for him.But he's not going to he's not willing to take the steps to part of depression is he doesn't want help.He doesn't want to talk about it.You would rather swim something and yell then say I'm angry because he should be better that.It's so extreme eating the suggestion.Is it that?Z really have a personality disorder.What does that I made the horrible mistake the other day saying I feel like you're two people sometimes like I feel it's a different personality.Sometimes I made a horrible mistake of that and then days later.He said you called me schizophrenic and I'm like, I never use that word Ivan like that is solike I really want this again sounds really horrible and it sounds really selfish but I'm really desperately want him to be evaluated and I want to find out what the heck quite frankly is going on because and I want if he needs to be taking medication if you needs to be seen doctor board a couple sessions twice, I don't know I need to know and then I need to happen you yesterday.He just tells me if anyone asked him to do any kind of evaluation you'd feel so disappointed in my get where that comes around because I'm talking to his dad who says if we screwed him up we'll deal with that.That's what he said to me.I'm like what is wrong with you?No wonder I've been as a stigma with that.He hears his parents refer to it as true.I don't.But he's going to be able to like I have no clue what's going on.Is she is he going to be able to come out of it is you going to be able toI know I understand why I've been wouldn't tell someone who I can understand.I didn't want to I hadn't looked at his notes since I found it.I wanted it all go away.The thing is things can go really well at home.If I bring up no issues by instigate no arguments.No discussions about anything this problem that I just cooked dinner and we watch a movie and make a point of talking about things that you know, he's not going to bring it up and then things are okay, but they're not okay.So I don't know how to actually felt like saying last time that I don't want to go anymore couples therapy because it feels so it feels almost.Yes, yes.I feel like I'm getting blamed by his parents.I feel like I'm getting blame by her.I feel like if I could just deal with the anger and resentment and if I didn't speak up last time and say this is too much.I need help that you wouldn't have suggested as a separate probably would like the marriage can work if it just put it all in a drawer and I don't.I really just keep coming back.Like I want to know what's going on with him and I want to find a way to deal with it and I want to move on and I can't deal with the next five years being like this.I guess it's my spring break.So I'm home.Unless I spend my days.I mean I could go to the library every day, butYou know as of this morning has a schedule for the next couple days.Should I even try to call his mom?I don't know.I'm sorry, okay.I wasn't going to I wasn't going to cuz it kind of like basically I'm going to therapy every day.But yeah, if you're not here the next week, then I should find a way to do it.That's what you have.Okay.LG 910 I guess.Okay.No, I'm sure I forgot.I'm sorry.Alright.Thank you.Did you stop it?I still feel like I'm stressed.Maybe I'm stressed but I don't know.I'm just afraid to ask my boss about the whole.Hey, can I?Thing, but I did say at work for a full day last week for all three days.I thought okay, I wasn't really panicking or anything like that.My dad's old computer was taking forever and I basically spend an hour or something.That should have taken 15 minutes.I think it's when I get up in the morning and I have to get myself to work or in the evening when I need to get things done before I go to bed and I'm like, how will have food for tomorrow or have dinner tonight?I never stressed at work.I might get panicky at work, but it's not from work is this dress like the preparation and a lot of time in the evening to Wine down and have dinner especially it's like me and Sydney are going to do something and then Sydney panics and then it's like okay.Can I do this myself?I don't know depending on what I'm doing the longer.I wait for him to stop panicking the last time I house.Sometimes it turns out that I end up going to bed later than I would have liked and I'm still able to get to work in the morning.Sometimes it ends up with me getting to work later.I've never been at the point where I've gone to work and didn't have anything to eat.I don't think I've ever had to miss dinner either.Missing in like like missing dinner.Sometimes it just feeling like I don't have any free time and I'm wasting away time doing whatever for Sydney or something.I don't know since I don't have work today.I don't have work again until tomorrow and I haven't had work since Thursday.Yeah, I guess it is usually worried about not having time to eat food or do laundry and happiness clean clothes for work.We end up doing laundry today.Maybe I should go out and shopping because right now there are four shirts that I use for work, which makes me usually have to do laundry once a week if I had more shirts for work and I couldDoing laundry every week the same thing would happen.It was just at least happen Okay, I can lend you that day.And that's what I ended up doing last week taking stuff in my laundry bag because his laundry hamper things are really really heavy is there is down to the basement at his place a really really steep.So if I'm doing laundry at his place is a lot easier if he carries them down, but I can carry down smaller amounts of things for myself, which I should be able to do if I have to question actually be dependent on him for laundry, and I'm notNot for that the right now.I'm also looking at making socks for him.There is a skank of two colors and one color is one that I have to use this soon and I haven't been able to find it.It's the second sock.So I wanted to match the first one and I've been looking around his room.I know it's in there somewhere.I'm 99% sure that it's there, but he needs to pay I've been can have some of his stuff but he always needs to clean up in order for me to find that he's like so it will be okay and I'm like it will only be okay if you clean it.If you sit around and just saying that it will be okay.And maybe anger annoyance.I guess stealing out of control for I can't really control his.Or living quarters for that matter.It makes it really hard when I lose things even this morning.He knocked over my glasses.I had them on the dresser and he was trying to find them this morning because I can't see anything without my glasses.He's like, are you sure you didn't put them somewhere else and I'm like, yes, I put them in one of the few places.They are neither.I heard you knock them over last night when you came back in and the lights were off you got annoyed like I was blaming him and I got annoyed that you got annoyed for me blaming him.It was his fault.He ended up finding them obviously because I'm wearing them but that was a very stressful way to wake up in that case.I started was helpless without him because I couldn't see anyting which is why I always put my glasses in a place that makes sense and not like he'll lose his and I always put mine somewhere that makes sense this time.He knocked him out.Is really annoying.I guess maybe I should be getting a spare pair but I don't actually have my prescription now then again, I guess it's been over two years since I've gotten you so I probably am due for my guess now that my parents are paying for all the medical stuff.I don't know that I can afford an optometrist.I don't even know if my house insurance covers it so.Yeah, I just don't want to have to pay hundreds of dollars.It's not like I'm blind or anything with you.So likeOh, yeah.I said this place is really hard to deal with when it's messy when I can feel the dirt on my feet.And I don't think I'm especially he thinks maybe it's my OCD or whatever but I don't I don't I'm actually especially sensitive to dirt when you have enough stuff on the floor that you can feel it on your feet, especially if you've taken a shower and then your feet are wet and the stuff sticks to your Beach.It's not a good feeling.It's getting harder and harder to deal with that.I mean, I guess I could take responsibility for cleaning his place.I just don't think it would be a very good idea and I don't think it would be necessary.It would necessarily make me happy.He has lots of big heavy boxes that I can't really move.So I will clean out the old parts of his place, but I'm not cleaning out his whole room.But then again, maybe it is if I want the room to be a place where I can put my things without losing them like maybe I mean you cannot desire therefore it should be my job.I guess he hasn't really know he does loses things like check books and stuff I usually end up finding them for him he does want to make his life better he just is doing it very slowly that's all fine and good until I can't find something that I need and then it's a problemI'm not really spending any time at my place right now which is another reason that stresses me out like when I'm in the kitchen by myself or something and I'm like I don't live here your roommates are all taking over too much at least 3 days a week I'm only home for a couple of hours that I'm not sleeping my room is sort of like where the air conditioner would go is not working so we don't even have an AC in there I got sick this weekend so I didn't even get to do the whole clothing Purge thing Sydney doesn't really like Aaron soThat makes him stress to be there.We usually end up going to his place because it's easier.I think he'll change when I get to my new place.It feels like those roommates are realized it's nice and it's a lot closer to his but they're really nice cat Slayer.That in the whole not having a gluten-free kitchen means not having to worry about going to a restaurant getting leftovers not being able to keep them up.I still have to hold out until September.It's the end of June.So I still have all of July August if I can hold out I'll be fine.I don't really know other than take one day a week like Sundays to start packing if I'm not sick.I guess if I could cook things on Sunday or Monday, it would take a bunch of work, but I could at least in theory make a few quiches.And then how does Yuki should be my lunch is for that we can possibly also.So I couldn't very cook things.I had my man.That would make the party's easier.I usually still in the morning getting breakfast together slows me down like even if I'm eating in the car if I put cream cheese on the rice cakes the night before then they'll get all sad.I haven't really experienced experimented with I've had I've at least figured out that I'mif I'm going to cut up vegetables it's better to do that at work and take a longer lunch than have that.Well, I just that but if I do it before I leave 15 minutes will make a huge difference in the commute.So I started doing that at work that feels a lot better for me.I can hold out until I get to work and eat a breakfast from there.That would also.Yeah, I'm usually Starving in the morning, but I briefly considered it and I was like that's not going to work.It wasn't such a long commute.Yeah, I kind of need to have caffeine to do it safely.Feels bad that I'm depending on caffeine.I was not dependent on it for like a good six years in high school.I was addicted to it but that also because high school started really really early in the morning kind of like now and I'm waking up at 6 and college.I had a couple of classes I had to wake up at 8 or something.Most of the time I could get away away wake me up later even in grad school was not too bad.It's only when I wake up at 6 a.m. That it's a problem.I guess that plus the whole can you find commute?It's probably the commute more than anything else.I'm not sure.What would be a good solution for making sure I have time for dinner.You haven't been nice that I haven't had dinner.Author happened nights.I've had to delay it and stuff.By having sleep, I guess the thing is it's a nice place.They have the kitchen and they have the living room right next to it with the TV is we usually end up eating in the living room.He doesn't really like eating with his roommate during the living room eating in the kitchen, and I don't likeGrossman concealer crumbs on the backYeah.Just get along.I don't know probably also in the summer because the kitchen is hot the living room at least has a fan.I don't know.I guess he's not comfortable eating in the kitchen.So if people aren't in the living room, but it's fine.But if they're in the living room that it's a problem and then he's also too sick to go out or something that we just have to wait one day.I made the compromise of eating in the room, but I really don't like doing that.He thinks I'm kind of crazy for not eating in my bedroom and I spent my whole life pretty much maybe a couple snacks, but I never had meals in my bedroom and I thought that's what normal people do.You thought was pretty typical even though he wasn't allowed to eat in his bedroom growing up.Just like I wasn't he thought it was critical that wants restriction is no longer there that people eat in their bedrooms all the time.I don't know who's not that either of us is right.really isn't a good one other than maybe going out but then if you can't go out that's not a compromise either like the compromise isn't really that we do something in the middle that will makeExcept that then if I'm at his place I'll feel uncomfortable eating in the kitchen by myself because I don't live there and that feels weird to people are around that doesn't really work.I guess I have to decide which is worse in the kitchen when there are people around when I don't live there or Sydney isn't there and it feels like it's less valid for me to just be there by myself.Or spending more time at my place.there's never anything to eat in my place now thatAnd Amy are gone Aries.Aaron is on grocery shopping.There's maybe a box of pasta in the downstairs area when there should be all the pasta.So Aaron isn't really been keeping up eating at my place would require a lot of planning and stuff and it doesn't really work when I just gotten home from work and it's like oh, yeah few hours.Yeah.That one is a problem.If I'm going to spend more time at my place.It would probably be on the nights that I don't have to work.Not always a problem.I guess I having a bunch of times in the last couple weeks.No, I really don't want of them is a PhD student.So sometimes she's never around and then sometimes she's always around one roommate doesn't use.Other three sometimes you win sometimes.And then I'll watch a show and then I'll end up being there for three hours watching many shows.Vermeer for himReally?It's like if he's there it's nothing if he isn't there, it's me, not living there and feeling like I'm taking up their space.There was once several several months ago, but that was before they knew that Sydney had serious depression and that he's explained it to them and that they were okay with it, I guess for me.I'm like, okay that was several months ago.I'm not sure if they're still okay with it under the understanding that I'm taking care of him.And then I'm thinking maybe they're thinking why is he not better yet?Why is Georgia still around since I don't know that I haven't talked to them about it.I don't really want to talk to them about it because I don't want confrontation and he says it's okay.That doesn't really help me because I'm not looking for him since it's okay.I want to know whether or not his roommate.I don't know.He doesn't need his roommates or anything, but I guess it's the social anxiety thing not wanting to be around anyone or not or anyone but me that makes him not want to eat.I don't think so.I don't think it was the case before he was depressed.Yeah, what she could do that for me.It doesn't really.I know because my place seems unlivable to I think I just have to hold out for another two months until September.I kind of really don't want to because I'm just afraid what would happen if they say, oh actually we're really pissed that you're over all the time.That's not much I can do that.maybe butother than spending more time at my place which again would require this planning or have stuff to eat because it's not like you've given others anything to eat, which is really annoying.Everybody has their own shopping.So people have different shelves on the fridge that are there.Is there a the problem in theory the problem is that certain things?Like if I have pasta I really want to have cheese on it if I have cheese and I actually can bring it to my house because I have to go down to Hampton.So it's not like I can justWhy would be my easiest meal other things would take a lot more work like practically all males?I could stop process that would be fine and right George on it, but I have to go to Hamden if I want anything to put on it getting vegetables.You can't get them that far as anything else.It would still require planning of Sydney wound up going to my place and having things for the morning and everything.It is the gluten-free kitchen is probably the most complicated factor that plus Aaron not really doing his job of getting food for the kitchen.Yeah, so really the only solution I can think of is to deal with it until September when I had a feel at home in my new place, but that still means two more months of this I survived is so far, but it doesn't really make that any better.I told him about it before he knows that I don't feel comfortable being there without him.I don't know maybe maybe into degrees he could I don't know if it would work out sometimes when he gets that depressed.He keeps on saying that he thinks he can't do XYZ things that I think he can do, but I'm not him.I don't know if it is a cop out or if it's he thinks his depression makes it so he can't physically do whatever saying and I think his depression is telling him he can't do that thing, but he could get around it.Maybe I don't want to make those assumptions for him though.Again, there's not much I can control in that situation.Yeah, that sounds about right.I need time in the day to go to Hampden and make my room and have it.I had to move a lot of things around for the new windows that theyNever talk to us really before he was doing at you like oh by the way, the guys are coming in to measure the today and they're coming in to install this on this day.I'm like, you should really spend that money changing that door between mine and Ryan's room in a walk, but I didn't actually say thatthere's a reason I'm not there all the time.I was there on Friday to get some errands done.I think we're going there tonight so I can be there because I have to book tomorrow morning.And obviously my address is still my place.So I need to get down there to move before work.I think what we'll do is have dinner before we go there that's off tonight, but that isn't the rest of the week to go shopping Hamden or something like that.But I'm the one who has the car when I'm at work that makes things harder to I guess you could take the T in theory and get there and get back, but it would be a big pain.There is not a gluten-free Market between here and Cheshire.They sell a lot of things that are gluten-free and grocery stores or rather.There is this one symbol that appears on a lot of cheese is that my house isn't practically speaking I can get ricotta a soft cheese has some of those will actually have a symbol that my house except those I can get at regular grocery stores.But anything else I need to go to Hamden is the closest place that will habit which is really frustrating.He was complaining about how his new job was going to have such a long commute.It's all the way out there where you see the signs on the highway and I'm like, oh like that's a third of my commute.I do not feel bad for you at all.Really?It does come down to not having enough time for that and still have some dinner and I'm only gotten tiny little minor things.I haven't really gotten to anything later yet.How 2 months I've taken June off and I think that will be a good problem.Maybe I'll be regretting that decision the end of August.Considering I don't really go over to my place, but I'll find I have enough clothes live off at Sandy's place.That would mean that anything that's in my room could be packed right now because I need it that badly it wouldn't be in my room.Bible Hub a little bit.I think last time I did move it actually did only take me a day to pack.I had a lot less stuff than I have now at night.Yeah, it's all that stuff.Like yarn shouldn't take that long.I don't see what else would be so big other than all that yarn for my store and all that yarn is in big bins in the basement.That's pretty much packed up.Yeah, and I guess the.I spotted a dyna bunch of yarn and using my stars and I can make that more flexible.Who's responsible up until the point that maybe those colors might not all go together.And then if I have to mix up other colors usually end up with more empty containers and I started with I guess I was really purposeful and I don't care if I made a really ugly color combinations I could do it.Is it bad that I'm using it for then again?If it's ugly then there are some people who like really weird color combinations that I know so as long as somebody can use it.Yeah, so that's not actually as bad.But if I'm doing more specialized things where I need certain colors, and I'm thinking about doing that before I move.I guess I'm doing it soon enough.I don't know.I guess the worst case scenario is going to die.But I'm using an East Coast thing.So if I had to put out 15 bands of different colors and rinse them out, it wouldn't be that big of a loss.Yes, I think if I had to do it, that would be a big deal.I think it's just the fact that my room isn't my light green eyes is probably with making it seem like such a big deal if I can just put things in the bins and contain them then maybe it wouldn't feel so bad.Maybe there's a smaller been in that my mom gave me that's in the back of Sydney's car and I guess for all the Yarns that are sitting around I could put as many of them as bit in that container and there will be that much fewer yarn calculator.I think I could continue and I believe that I wouldn't need any of those four projects anytime in the near future or just make sure that I have lost that II'm not working out anytime soon.Yeah, I can probably do it on Friday.As long as I don't help for I'll maybe I'll do it.I'll do more after that because if I start doing.I might get too disappointed if I die.Okay, that's the part that feels really hard because I'm like, oh I should be able to pack up everything.Yeah, that's true that someone change the whole evening getting food situation.Yeah.It also doesn't say that I couldn't go out by myself.Other than now I'm spending all the money.I guess the weight loss thing.I didn't take a break in terms of eating vegetables one day.I had a fruit or a vegetable.My lunch is all 30 days of work.That's all good.I needed to go to the grocery store and get stuff for so we can have those things on the days that I'm not having Works did he apparently is losing right now just by eating and I don't know what he did but he was like, oh, I love you.I'm worried that I can't do the same thing.I don't know what it is other than I guess you was doing a lot more overeating and I was when he was super depressed and now that I guess that isn't true.It's actually working you feeling less depressed and I will order last ridiculous things for 1No, it's not.I just don't want to be this overweight.I guess it's just discouraging that he can do it without seemingly little effort.Yeah.Serena and I'm adding the actual to my diet.Should that be helping I mean, I guess that's helping eating healthier, but I might not be helping.I think they're replacing in terms of I can get away with less other things like it would normally be that if I got one of those microwave Meals one thing by itself might not be enough always fruit it is or pieces of pizza.I will eat less slices of pizza if I'm having fruit with that then if I'm notAt least even if I don't get a coffee drink in the morning if I'm high.Rice cakes and I'm not having a cookie with it.So it's a healthier choice.But at least one alternative even if I'd gone to get coffee.I don't have a donut with it.I'm assuming a coffee drink has less but it's not less fat than a donut.I don't even know.Maybe they'll I'm at least eating less Donuts than I was so I think until I get less stressed.I might continue with the drink.Like how much of my days calories if it's like 50% of the calories?I definitely looked it up many many years ago and it might have changed if they put different things in it and stuff.Even though it's really hot.If it doesn't take forever for me to do stuff at the bus stop like walking around for a bit until Sydney is out of his therapy today yesterday actually in the evening.I walked for 1/2 and intended to be a small trip and then I stayed out for a half an hour.I was walking for most of that.I haven't even looked at the scale in a week or two and I don't even know if I want to look at it.FridayWe're not meeting next Monday.I think it's the first.Hi, I kind of need a haircut.So I want a couple of days ago, but all of my friends are depressed like all of them and I was talking to Lucy about this about how you know, I had plans with Yvonne later this week and I was really dreading it because you Vons miserable about the divorce and she feels like her life is over, but she's behind on work.She does freelance writing and she also has a day job like 25 hours a week.I like whenever we hang out.It's just constant stream of like I can't write I'm so blogged.I have all these projects.They're all kind deadline.I feel so terrible.My house is a shithole, but no don't help me clean it because I'm too embarrassed to anyone help me clean it, but I'm just going to tell you about how miserable I am that it's a shithole while we're sitting in the middle shithole while I'm sitting while I'm sitting Legos literally because I can't put them away because I would shame her feel like there are no places to sit that aren't covered in walking Legos.And like her kid is misbehaved, but then she doesn't discipline your kid.I'm also watching her like actively not just wondered yet while her kid is misbehaving while she's telling me that she's so miserable with that hurricane is missing hate that are kid misbehaves and like it's just literally draining and horrible, you know.Lazy parrot are you familiar with the spoon metaphor for energy?So some disability activists row about it to describe what it's like to live with lupus and it's just this.But like you have these physical tokens, let's call them spins.Like you're holding a handful of spoons from the silverware drawer and every action you do requires you to give up a stew and when you're out of the handful of spoons, you're just done for the day.You can't do anything more.You can't go out.You can read them that you can't cook dinner.Done.These are burned so likeYeah, so the metaphor is you know, how many spoons do you have?Are there a lot of spoons Lucy made me the analogy that he our Kevon is like having you gone take all of the screens and drop tops and down the garbage disposal and that I should not make myself the picture on mater of the horribly mangled spoons drop down the disposal.She kind of had a point.But like I tell her I care about her and want Briley every one I lean on for emotional support is also like horribly depressed and feels like their life is spinning out of control is miserable.Last night I had a long last night.I had an hour long conversation with my friend Vanessa that just gotten 10-year last week.I feel like years of working towards it but she feels like a failure because she had some publishing papers and she had a sub down from like some leadership position in our department and she's going through another divorce if I get a severely autistic because your kids therapist have been embezzling the entrance for like 6 years the government decided that all of his therapist patient.We're going to be denied Services because they're not really sick and she has to restart the whole evaluation and diagnostic process over with a new therapist.I was like, she's got a lot of horrible circumstances going on like she spent an hour literally telling me about she's an academic failure, which he's got tenure.She's deeply depressed like borderline suicidal a depressed and I don't really know what I can do to help her other than make her sure to go find a therapist of her own which I've been doing.But it's not helping me at all like spend an hour on the phone with someone who is telling me in detail about their suicidal ideation.But you know, this is the one I've been friends with for a long time and I can see if I care aboutYeah, I don't none of my friends are happy and that sucks.I really miss Ashley and I realized a part of it while I mean part of it just that you know, I'm still half in love with her and part of it is, you know, the physical and sexual aspects of the relationship and certainly part of it was in spite of knowing intellectually that he was really depressed and miserable and has been for quite a while.He fakes being okay really?Well.So when we were on date to pretend everything was normal and you talk about his depression the way all of my other friends did.Yeah.Yeah.No, it is.Yeah.Like I mean, she'll talk about how she's feeling about how she'll say, you know, I'm miserable because Christopher is yelling at me to move my stuff out of his apartment faster.I really can't because I don't have any because I don't have the time and have this job and I'm behind on my deadlines and it feels miserable that I'm behind on my deadline every time I sit down to write I have panic attacks and I'm just on the floor crying and then she sang this shall be like crying and it's just yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.rightYeah.Like I wonder if there isn't just some kind of feedback link going on that we're all depressed and we all have stressful unhappy things going on.Just do I laying on it with each other.It's just kind of exacerbates the negative feeling for all of us.I don't know.Like it's exhausting and I'm guilty for being exhausted by it.Yeah.5 or 6 or something like that.Yeah.Right, will the kid's father isn't any better and neither of them discipline sir?And in part because we both came from abusive authoritarian household.And so they're both terrified that theyIf they ever like saying no or X or any discipline or try to take control of her behavior in any way that they'll tip over the line and she abusive with her.Yeah.Yeah.I know and it's like super frustrating when we hang out and like when she has a kid because we can't actually have a grown-up conversation because the kid interrupts like every 30 seconds and needs constant attention.Yeah, well, what's your three year olds you expect them to be asleep by 9 at night which medicine didn't like they've never had a consistent bedtime for her either which doesn't help.I've been over at their place like when we split up at like 11:30 midnight and the kid would still be awake and hanging out watching TV and it's just like not I don't know what they're going to do when they have to start school in the fall.Yeah.Yeah, and like in the past I tried saying, you know Madison I'm having a grown-up calm conversation with your mom.Please don't interrupt like not stepping into a role of disciplining her but like speaking to her.I went to another adult like I'm having conversation.Can you hang on a minute?And then the kid just has a total meltdown and says, you know goes into a total kid mode of you're not the boss of me.You're not my mom.You can't tell me what to do.I want to talk to my mom and then it just like a zillion times worse.It just it's just like there's no I mean, I guess there is no reasoning with you know, a kindergarten so no matter whatAgain, one time leave before so I was over at their place for movie night and they were trying to just bleed to get the kids to go to bed and getting off during bedtime rituals why they were watching the movie which I thought was a little strange with a bedtime ritual lasted an hour and a half and there was the peeing the and the brushing teeth Method Man eating a snack.But the Bedtime ritual lasted an hour and a half and there was a p and a brushing the teeth and then demanding a snack when I'm brushing the teeth again and the demanding water the demanding a story and then coming out of the ground mending more water than wanting another story because now she's out of bed.And at one point she insisted she wanted me to reach her story.They both just kind of looked at me helplessly and you can reach her story, please.I was like, what the hell is this?So I read the cat a story and then she didn't like the way I wrote the story.So I had to read it again using funny voices for the funny character.I was just like Jesus Christ.And I feel bad criticizing their parenting because you know, I don't have kids myself.That way you never know what it's like to parent a difficult child until you have one and it's like I'm not there on the ground 24/7 with it, but it's not it's just it's destructive and stressful.Yeah, like it's destructive and it's stressful.Especially the kid starts shrieking like high-pitch loud wailing and it's just pitiful to be over there.Yeah.No.And like I'm sure it's just in Yvonne that we hang out on nights when she doesn't have the kid but on nights when she doesn't have the kids.She's usually like going to lectures or like going to events that she's going to be reporting on or in the office late working.So she doesn't want to hang out or nice that she doesn't have Madison.I've tried suggesting will just hire babysitter.I'll pay for the babysitter.Let's go out for dinner.But you know and she's like, well, you know Madison only sees me part of the time.I don't really want the babysitter and Christopher might use that against me in the divorce proceedings.She's worried that Christopher is going to try to get full custody of Madison with only supervised visits for her.Frankly.I kind of see her point and if I were Christopher I sure as hell would want full custody.with only supervised visits for her because she's not like Christopher is also permissive and doesn't discipline the kid, but at least like he keeps his house clean and the kid isn't living inLike yeah, like Yvonne actually told me I didn't witness this but Yvonne told me that you know, the kid had been sleeping on sheets that smells like piss for three nights because she don't have the spoons are energy to like wash your sheets after Madison peed on them again.And she hoped that maybe now Madison will learn a lesson about peeing in the bed having to sleep in piss smell smelling sheets and I was just like so horrified so immensely horrified like sure you want to teach your kid not sweat the bed and since Madison had been sleeping completely drive for like 2 years like it's pretty clearly acting out because she's unhappy about the divorce, but the answer is not having your chicken sleeping sheet that smells like piss.That's like that's just awful.And I know it wasn't like deliberately.She just really cannot cope with like doing another load of laundry, but still like yeah, it's Madison or my kid.I wouldn't want you gone to have you been full custody.And of course, I can't say that because I'm supposed to be on her side with a divorce and justI'm sorry.This has been turned into like the third-party diagnosing of Yvonne's problems instead of talking about me.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.I do feel almost like I'm litigating a case.You're like you're as all this evidence.I've collected and I'm presenting to you.Please validate that my feelings are not crazy.But like I'm supposed to go hang out with her in her house tomorrow night, but I'm already feeling anxious and upset about it and dreading going over there and like yeah.Yeah.Well, like part of me is also frustrated because she didn't take my advice when Christopher first asked for the divorce.I told her you need a lawyer.You need to split the assets.Now, you need to have a bank account in your name and she didn't listen.She was like Christopher and I were together for 10 years and he loves me and he cares about me and he wouldn't screw me over now.He's like not giving her the password to the joint account.Like you changed the password won't give it to her drained at the most of the funds and private account for him.And Mike is a shuttle asshole and she was trying to negotiate with him and hisOn her own and like she's been like she has screwed herself over financially and even though she has legal counsel.I'm like she's not going to get as much Financial ERAnd now she's complaining to me about how she screwed financially and she didn't text back.This was Christopher.I was like I told you four months ago that you needed a lawyer.It's really hard for me not to respond to that with well you brought that on yourself.But like I feel I don't know.I feel like a jerk every time I tell her I think she's doing something wrong like she wanted couples counseling and she wanted to know why Christopher wanted to divorce and she I don't know from where I'm standing.It looks like she emotionally curse and belittle him into going into counseling with her.and you know Christopher said in counseling and he said before canceling and he has been very consistent aboutThat he feels like their marriage has been emotionally abusive towards him and he just wants out and there's nothing she can do to convince him.OtherwiseShe made him do this like 10 week counseling program to try to repair the relationship anyway, and I tried telling her like this is not fair to him.Even if he is wrong about calling you abusive.I think he is and even if he's being a kind of a dick about this if you wants to be off the relationship he gets me out and he doesn't owe you an explanation.I'm like it would be nice.If you did out of respect for like 10 years you were together, but you know, he had to leave a relationship doesn't want we all have that right but where woman singer husband was forcing her to like try to repair the relationship when she wanted out you would both be infuriated and Yvonne was like but like he owes me he owes it to me and I was like, there's no I don't know it's or maybe he's not wrong about being emotionally in this relationship.I don't know he's gotMinnesota from his parents.He has numerous problems.Good morning.Do you know any therapist in Maryland?Okay, one of the funniest friends visited over the weekend her sister has just moved to Maryland and is struggling to find a therapist that works for her.Thanks, if it's not too much trouble.I think so.I feel like last week's session was very helpful.So I've asked if you could want me more and keep I really appreciate that.I feel much less.I was floundering.So thanks.I think you asked a question.Did I feel like I was floundering in my everyday life.I think I sort of said yes.Yes and know the answer is probably more.Yes, then no in some ways, but like this is an anchoring point in some sense.So helpful to be here and particular helpful last week.So, thanks.I think I also expressed that I felt anxious while we were talking.I didn't really have a reason as to why but after I left I think that because it's that I rely on the session that I was and sometimes am anxious.Like we won't get to something not that I have a particular thing.I need to get to but like the time is very precious to me.So I might waste it or something.So those are my summarize thoughts.We were talking at the end about what constitutes a good reason or bad reason for making relationship decisions.I thought maybe we could take that up again.Thanks.It's sort of it occurs to me that I should probably talk out some of the features of last week.So it's my new friend Candice came to visit Candice was trying his roommate.I will even married very good friend.She's great.The one of the few people for who was always good for for who for Tanya.It's always good to visit.Soit's helpful to have her it's good.She got in on Wednesday and then left Friday evening.So it's kind of a strange time.But she was on spring break from the teaching job.She works atSo I think that the most save me a piece of that is that like I think there's two pieces of it that in terms of preparing for Candice to visit, you know, cleaning the apartment converting the room that we have a table and to a room that has a bed in there.So Candice could stay with us.I did all of that work.So particular, you know just how guess so maybe the more important things is Candace Scott in on Wednesday when Tony was at work and so Candice and I sat and talked for a while then her sister.I don't know if I knew this and had forgotten it but I think that I knew this her sister is bipolar and that was a real struggle withShe had been diagnosed with that in high school for Candice.So it was interesting to talk with her some about how this affected funniest illness affect her and sort of for understanding of my position in them.I have the sense that I can express but not explain very well that like being able to walk or being able to talk with Candice and that way was something that is missing from my relationship with Tanya to a large extent.Not particular about those subjects, but those were part of the conversation.So that seems important.Yes, that's the right question.But I don't know how to answer it.Did you ever like sit and have coffee with someone for a couple of hours that Iyou might like it and sort of talk about New Zealand or what you're thinking about and progressed through bad to talk about like what?Here's a whole conversation that has many different parts of describing experience you understand.That's another thing.I don't know how to articulate a better than that, but there's a sense of like scope and depth.Talk about many things and it doesn't have to stay shallow in any way.There are only intense moments of danger or some kind in the conversation.Sorry, I said it and I sort of saw you grab on to that one.I think you should and I understand why you would but yes.Yes, I know.Yes.So there are certain topics that like set Tanya off.Or that's funny can't talk about those feel dangerous to me because I don't trust 28 to handle her emotions.So I guess I don't have trust that.It's going to be okay or like that.Candice and I were talking like I don't know that was I think a very hard time for her.Yeah.And so I was I said, well, you know where boxer there and some senses.But we're back in the hospital.This is Rita and some stones or feels like it and so it's sort of raise the question of like this ever going to go away.What is our future look like.And I think that was when she told me that her sister was bipolar and that like it had made her Search Wonder also whether this was a thing what that was going away or whether this was men and so we both sort of side with that moment and she was okay.I need to talk about something else.That's too much and so he did.No, no the last part that I need to talk about something else.Like this is going to be personally, can you move?Yes, yes.Yes.Protecting yourself also and expressing her needs at a time when they can be met still.Not same situation 21 on say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were.That's not helpful to anyone.Not that it's expected to be overwhelmed by feelings, but that likeso I think that's a larger part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger.Yeah.Yes, yes, and we supposed to situations where things like that are coming up or are going to come up like some sense of being able to drop her.Boundaries and say like I need to not go there right now before you've been there.So in couples counseling Monday, I can't remember exactly how the conversation evolves over time but it ended up talking about 20 of work at her church being about like taking care of people sometimes like going and she would go.Sorry and she would go to the morning service on Sunday sometimes and then like afterwards that was summer to visit.someone who couldn't make it to churchYes, and she talks about it in the context of like this is a thing that is normally very good for her but gets very very hard as she gets worse.Dr. Janice picks up on the it as a thing.Like this is a thing that helps you feel better which is true and the nice observation, but he also been like bra.That's why our relationship in the context that like maybe she would feel better.If she felt like she could take care of me which is definitely a saying that she says or believes or wants to do which eventually to me expressing The View that I I don't particularly trust her and that description of the issue.The one that you was giving sounds to me like you should let her take care of you as another thing.That you do not buy you do to make her feel better.Like you should extend some arbitrary amount of stress not because it's like because I will help her and I found it frustrating.Oh, yes.Yes, perhaps less the lightly than I would have liked.Yes.I guess I started the summary off of the things that happened that week by saying that I did all the preparations for Candice to come visit that takes time in addition to like spending some time with Candice all weekend to sort of catch up on the things that I have.I have not done while I was doing those things.It's very frustrating to carry like I guess it's frustrating anytime.It's particularly frustrating.Contacts to hear like well if you just do a little more Tony will be better like if you know where yes, if you do a little more 20 would be better.Maybe that's true somewhere but I don't think that's the point at the end of the day.I think that the plant the end of the day is that when you can't take care of herself or can't always take care of her so I've certainly become frustrated talking about it.I'm not sure if I articulated why I'm frustrated butYeah, so let me make the analogy a little bit worse by stretching it more than it probably needs.So now turning to your personal trainer the coach and you're running a relay race and one of the one of your relay race Partners has a broken leg, but the coach is still trying to train you to win the race.I think more how it feels.Well, if you just run twice as fast like, you know, you guys will almost be as good as me whereI feel like it was good at doing that.At least I'm glad that it works.So, you know, it's and part of the thing about feelings is that I don't think that's actually what he is doing and you know, I actually think he's very good and I'm glad that we got to him for the most part.But right now I'm very frustrated with this idea of like trying to make a relationship better when I'm back on yet is out of the crisis where she has hospitalized but she's still pretty bad like she's not doing well.So we go there in like we can't really talk.About trust.I mean we did because that was where the conversation went.And I didn't avoid it like I do sometimes but ends up in the place where I stay like, I don't trust here and why should I so which I feel like it's not particularly helpful to Tanya when she is, you know, struggling with her broken likeyes.Sorry, I wasn't laughing to dismiss that.Yes at the Viewpoint that I am committed to also but I don't always feel.So yesterday so Sonia like in the morning Tony will get up and then get ready for the day and then I'll get up around the same around the time that she leaves depending on when she leaves because she leaves at different times of day and so often it's the case that she'll she'll like come say goodbye as I'm still half-asleep.So yesterday she sort of said in a slightly peculiar way.Goodbye James, which she never really says my name when she is saying the but I don't know why I think and you know, so I was concerned for a portion of the day that she was going to kill herself.I think that expressed my feelings about the truth and dangerous or something toYou know that was strikingly direct.I appreciate it.Yes.I don't know how to make that decision with what you think, you know, so half of this is why would anyone want this?You know that all hinges on the meaning of want or the righty of different maybe hinges on this?I don't know yes or no other contacts.I have something like Siri responses to uncertainty.When is to formulate a test case.I will differentiate between possible outcomes that's not really icy.And no way to do that here when the large uncertainty is what's going to happen in the future that really becomes not a useful way of handling.The problem 1 is to reduce uncertainty see as much as possible and then leave the uncertainty uncertainBut that usually goes hand-in-hand with the other one.So like here's a range of possible mechanism for a chemical reaction.We can rule out all but two of them.You can't decide between them but leave at least ruled out all the other ones.You did that sometime ago right you presented the main fold of world in which I would be okay and hens essentially two features on it.SoAnd that was helpful in the short-term and that's not particularly helpful in like which of those will I need will I end up or should I end up on?And a third it's a sort of attempt to estimate the uncertainty.What about it and some way?I'm not sure that's actually feasible here either so I didn't see a real well beyond that just said something about uncertainty.I don't know what to do about that.Actually, I think there's a four thing to so in terms of like personal decisions.I think I will attempt to sort of observe other people making simple decisions and sort of monitor my reaction to them and sometimes that's helpful.It's the reason that I like well written TV shows actuallyYes.Yes.I did not clarifying.I was sort of sitting here thinking about so if I were to stay Iwhy this marriage it's clear to me that I need to construct the rest of my life in such a way that is fulfilling in the ways that this marriage is not or else.I wouldn't be happy right because which is more or less exactly what you said many months ago.Yes.I was also thinking about I don't want this but I also think that those aren't and I don't want to walk away from that commitment that I made but if I hadn't made that commitment, I wish I would have my only reasons for not walking away.Would be concerns for Tanya's well-being in the short run.Like I actually don't want to hurt her.I do love her.Yes.I hadn't thought about.That seems like an interesting topic for all.In terms of it's that important to me.Why don't I find it the same thing or something like that?Yes, I need to think about that a little bit more.I sort of feel like there are broader implications, but I can't pull them all out right now.And I also feel like it's a little bit my own thoughts on its on it are sort of distracting from the main point if that makes sense.Yes, I guess another way to describe it as I feel like there's a conflict between myYou put it commitment work commitment to commitment and my desire to not be unhappy forever or not be unhappy.Right now and I guess there is some resolution to that conflict in while you're just saying I also don't know how to work out.Thank you.Morning.So I wrote a check for you and I forgot to bring it.So I'm very sorry about that.So we ended the last session you sort of talked about Siri and what we're doing here in your construction of it.So I'm that I do not have anything to say, but I guess I want to say thank you and I appreciated you talking about it.It it it took me a few minutes after I left to sort of sort out my feelings, but I was very grateful for you to you were talking about it just it was it was interesting and also comforting and sort of reassuring.Like you were saying that not only is it essentially okay that I interact with the world and a particular fashion, but it is necessary that we construct their use to make sense of our reality.I also felt like you were sort of I don't want to say casually dismissive of like particular strengths of theory and I like that and anyone who is an expert at something.It's nice because it's sort of I mean, I got bogged down and sort of questioning everything.That's not always necessary.That's nice.I so you started said that you know that Psychotherapy gets a bad rep and deservedly so we're focusing too much on everything comes from your childhood.But then you go to develop the second order of theory of it's important but it's important because of the way you construct Lincoln trucks theory is about how one exists and continues to do so your time.So but you know that sort of casually dismissive of that string theoryOh.Sorry, I meant offhandedly.but fair enoughI'm I'm not at all surprised to hear you say that.But it's sort of like we've been doing this for a long time and it's not like we have talked about.What we're doing, but you're also providing in some ways more details here than you have at other times or makes more sense in these last two discussions is also nice because I feel like you you're talking about what you do and it's important to you.I find that interesting soYes.Yes.Thank you for that.What was that last part?You said?It's not random.Yes, you're very proposed Civ and what you do and that and some ways that has been very clear.So you're sort of saying yes, of course and it's in this particular fashion.Yeah.I mean that's also reassuring but I guess I was sort of sitting here wondering why you would say that but you just answered but I'm also wondering whether I have like suggested to you that I think what you do is random because I don't I don't think that's how I think about it, butYeah, and in many circumstances the answer is sort of I know you sort of you push on that idea before and suggesting that I perhaps undervalue the extent to which the people who are doing things are doing them for a reason that might be true.But so in that instance another thing that I found very frustrating about it was that sort of goes through the same sequence when they need Tanya so it was like they hear her story and they seem to start constructing essentially a similar sequence of series as if while securing the history in which she is talking about seeing a whole bunch of other people and who do their job they are recognizing that the other people will have constructed the thing theories and at their first conclusion has probably already been tried that sort ofSo it's sort of like, you know, you were giving in many ways a very complex level of theory and to you, you know, it's I guess it's simple and that it's it can't be expressed simply but it's all so yeah, I guess I feel like at the As I understood what you were saying.You would say something like well, obviously these things that have been that have happened in Chinese life are important but at least as important as she has responded to them.And the sort of responses she has constructed internally and the narrative she has constructed internally to explain what is going on in her life.Maybe everyone in your discipline feel the same way or believe the same things or I don't even feel so many things but that's not at all clear.So yeah.This is also related to trust more generally there is a there's a sense in which I seem to look for probably something this is probably some specific marker, but I don't know what I could articulate what all of them are that indicate that there's a forethought into what's going on and that an understanding of both what's being done and the effects that is having because most organizations have a structure and mow structures do something to the people in them and not just something to the final product also.Yeah, and that disappointment is related to this you suggested I have a tendency to despair.Is go ahead you agreed like you were going to say something.Yeah.That's right.And so, you know, I've been working on it describing that as of thing that happens is has been helpful.And also you we spend a lot of time talking about things could be non-ideal and still okay and still even good.Yeah, I think in a general sends, it seems helpful to have the non-ideal ideality be acknowledged.But there are unhealthy ways of doing that people will say things like well nothing is perfect.That's true.But that's you know, that's the if my view of things is not ideal and therefore bad it's naive then the converse is also naive nothing's perfect.So anything is okay is equally ridiculous.Really?That's yeah, and I often feels that way to me.It's like well, you know, we can't make it perfect so we might as well just not try to do anything at all.No, nomadic infused.We're doing something different today than we usually do.I'm pleased by it.So soI feel like you're talking a lot more and I also feel like you're it's as if you're pushing and some specific Direction, you're continuing to bring us back to some set fixed.I don't know if my I don't know how the I don't know how it's working on your end.And I feel like I have now Disturbed if I talk about it, butYeah, that's fine.Yeah, I guess I yeah, that's fine.Anyway, yeah, thank you.You're keeping things moving in a particular line of some of the things that we've talked about before to continue the conversation.We're having to present.It's not that you don't do that ever, but you several in a row anyway, so Tanya perfectionism me not the same internal rigidity.Yes, and it yeah and it's really problematic.I'm like, I understand the desire for your Perfection, but you know, I don't think you and I talked aboutBut she and I and dr. Janice talked about.Talk to a couple weeks ago about anger and the sense in which one of them not the only but one of the causes of herself injury and suicidal suicide is her utter inability to deal with the anger from anyone else or herself.That's my description of it.There is not theirs butshe'll get angry and she's not allowed to express the anger by herself.She does not allow herself to express the anger because any expression of anger is bad because I don't know.I don't follow the logic of it.It's a particular motion or traumatic logic, but it's not okay to express anger.And so she internalizes it something like being angry because she is angry of becoming angry at herself for being angry at someone else and wanting to express that and buttons up and self-injury and if it goes on long enough course particularly acute suicide, so, you know now I guess you were talking about ways that I can understand and relate and I'm talking about now the piece that I really can't relate to buy.Now I have the sense that by talking about what we're doing.I've just I've Disturbed it.I know that that's not strictly true, butYeah, it's a really interesting choice of words.Yeah lost is the word that comes to mind more than ruin.But yeah, there's a sense of yeah, I guess there is a sense of Ruin to it just isn't that you know, I understand why you ask a question before is sort of resume the word does does that make sense?So or sometimes the opposite happens?It's like very much.Yes, and then also like yes, I can see why you were asking that question make some kind of particular sense.Yeah, yeah like by talking about it.I made it go away.So yeah, there's a sense of ruined.I think of course, there's also a you know by asking the question you were also demonstrating that wasn't really true.So kind of an interesting, you know, I feel like a question is about how I interpret the world and sort of us are really fundamental way in a conversation that we're having that's about how I interpret the world but I also feel like one of the things that you sometimes suggest is that I interpret the world for lack of a better world incorrectly.Like I am not ruin this conversation in any real sense.I prescribed it in the sense of every time one of us speaks a conversation is altered by that's the meaning of conversation soYeah, yes.I think I think there's a difference in I mean like I don't have an answer but I feel like a large part of what we're doing here is struggling to interpret or understanding what's going on in my life for me.When we get to a point where I feel like I understand something and often my focus will shift to talk to you in some sense.It's like that's where we start the session is, you know, I am acutely aware that your present then I come back to that when I feel like I have things in hand or something like that.But that maybe that's a good description because that's also somewhat true emotionally.So the couple of times we sat largely in silence for periods of time you suggested during one of those.But you thought it was very important to give people space.That's just a thing that was missing from our culture more generally.So years ago I used to be able to like look at a person and think while I was doing it.Somewhere.I don't know early in my Ph.D program.I stopped being able to do that.I don't know exactly why something like being acutely aware of what's going on with you Enterprise my thought process so I it's not helpful by my advisor who has like very bright blue eyes and sits very attentively like like a Pleasantburg, but it was just like has a very intense gaze and we'll wait for you to talk.In many ways.Yeah, but much more expected Lee.I feel like especially you and you sit and I feel like there is an expectation that I will speak but your gaze is not particularly expecting if that makes sense.Like you're not staring at me like okay.What are you going to say now?It's your turn to talk.Whereas in some ways that suitcase Gerard has I don't think he I think she both realizes it and doesn't not realize it.It's the gays he has after he's asked if there are questions in the class or ask a question.She will look around the room and wait for someone to respond.He seems perfectly content to wait for long periods of time or some it has the effect of when there are actually question.Someone will eventually ask a question butCozumelI have no idea.I observed it both, Kurt.I think you know as an explanation, so I've read recently.So I ride wrestler recently at that old people are not any dumber than they were when they were young.We cannot 70 they just have a lot more information to process.And so it takes them longer to find a particular facts.I don't know if it's true, but it was I found a whole lot in the last several years.Axe.I find when I'm learning a whole lot all at once likethis is longer process individual thing.So I think these two things happening at the same time pulling into it and maybe make sense in this context for one way of describing.Why is that I can't process all of what's happening or happened.SoSo I have I have a son.So I have I have a sense of how one eventually make sense of facts, but do you feel like one makes sense of emotions in the same way over time?Is there a different set of contracts or tools are features about oneself that allow him to process emotional or emotions feelings?Yes, I have the experience of Ozzy were talking about it.You know you were talking about it and it made good sense.Then he sort of sad but also not intellectually, you know, it's not just facts.It's also feelings.Yeah, of course, but I have much less clear sense of how do you sort out feelings?Yeah, and I guess one of the ways that I do that is I reject them into the fox say so but I recognized we talked and that in a sense identifies and tags feelings and particular Trends in my feelings.Any monitor those when they're happening that allows me to continue to experience them as feelings, but also recognized that's part of a repeated thing in common in some sense.This is I feel like things are ruined.It's okay.They are not ruined.They not only they are ruined they're probably not very damaged and at this point things are still likely to get very salvageable.That's you know, some line like that is sufficient toGet into the space where I can where I have sufficient agency do think so.Sure.Sure.Yeah this point I'm just sort of curious and that I've sort of described a way that I process feelings.It's certainly not the only one I don't think but it's very important in that kind of Time.How do other people process feelings?What do you do while I'm thinking over here?I you don't have to think about anything.I was that particular formulation of the questions opposes an answer.And so but I really meant what do you do do you think aboutother things as a you know anything or because there's a real sense in which like I am engaged in something else.I have no idea what you're doing.You know, I didn't think it that there is an element in which it's like it's a particular feature of like we are here having a conversation and I think about something else for a while, but that's a that's a feature of a meeting soften one person is usually stalking.Usually there's lots of other people who are not talking so they're doing something it's also a feature of like dinner with more than one person.So and I do Wonder like what other people are thinking about my other contacts also, but sometimes I have a clear sense of what they're doing and I do here so like in a lot of meetings I know which of my colleaguesAre spending most of the time on their phone because they really don't want to be in the meeting and we're hardly engaged when they were looking at him.So I don't ask them like what they were doing because I know if that makes sense.Yes to the last part.I have not a lot to say there but I think that's probably the place we should the thing we should talk about.But thank you for the direct answer.Also, that was very interesting in it very much matches my experience of like how you interact with me, you know, you often say something like this came to my mind, which is entirely consistent with what you just said that is you know, so thanks for sharing.I appreciate now what's going on?Alright.Thank you.U2I'm okay.I think I don't know.I'm kind of not sure I feel okay today.I don't know.I think I'm definitely kind of mildly depressed or something.I feel tired.I was just a crazy.I was already feeling a little bit off before all of this shit happens.Soit was crazy was definitely traumatizing.There's no question.Thursday after they killed that cop and got chased into Chest Tire.I don't know it's going to take some time.And then what was it 20 hours?I don't know.It's hard to put into words that kind of hair because at that point your life.Well, this guy has nothing obviously he knows it's over they didn't care about dying or killing other people.So it would just make sense if I was that person andand that insane then it would only make sense to just knock mySomeone's door take a few more people out and just blow yourself up.There are no words to explain it to feel like that could happen.I mean, yeah, there were armed.But all that takes is a second if he knows he's going to die.Anyway, just do it.It was a fucking it was just you know, I don't know.Oh, yeah, I just like the sounds were so loud.It was clearly there was no confusing.I mean it was surreal.It was surreal.Suddenly.It sounded like there was a war going on.The horrifying part the first thing I thought because it sounded like it was so much noise.It didn't sound like two or three people.I was horrified that they come to Josiah and there was some kind of group.Do you know what I mean?And that there was suddenly 30 insane people waiting fully armed for me.I don't know what that was horrifying horrifying.No idea no idea.No, I was wide awake.I had just walk down that way.Night.It was a nice night since I already wasn't feeling that great that week.I was like, you know, I'm just going to take a walk.I walked right where all went down like around 11 and then I got home and I was talking to my friend in Phoenix.So we were talking I had the window kind of open and I saw all these cops flying down the street and I thought that's weird.The cops were going really fast.I was like, yeah, this is not normal then by the time I told grgoGiorgio I heard two loud noises and then I hung up.Yeah, I grabbed Cecilia.I grabbed my shoes.My mom was already awake.I was like we're going right now.We're getting in the car and we're going but then for whatever reason I thought to call 911 when I told them my address and stuff and they were like just turn off all the lights and don't go near the windows.Definitely do not leave your house lock all the doors.It was crazy on the other hand once it was over.I also felt a tremendous.Amount of I mean, I've never been prouder to be from Chester between the corporation of citizens and law enforcement.That's fucking amazing.We're going to get the 911 guys just fucking Han hunted them down like dogs.It's kind of weird.I don't know when I think it felt like a police state.It was a police state that was kind of weird.I don't know how you get around that if this is the world we're going to live inYou're going to have to give up some civil liberties.So when it was all over it did feel good.I went out with people thinking cops and that felt pretty amazing.They were doing all these sweeps.They came over to her house several times one of the times on Friday before they get called this guy.The police on the Block knocked on the door and went down and it was casually very moving because when I open the door suddenly, they became very human.They were like, hey, we're just doing a door-to-door.We want to see how everyone is doing.Are you guys doing?Okay?That was very moving actually, but then it's depressing because I know this is going to happen again.I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.It's just very depressing.It's a big country and there a lot of people just random just freaks over all I guess.I'm okay.I just feel tired.I definitely kind ofI definitely feel kind of depressed.I don't feel very motivated.I've been feeling a little bit sick to my stomach.I was telling my mom everything would be okay, but in my mind I was like well, what are the chances of him coming in the house?Yeah, but then I was like what are the chances of anything of any of this is happening.It is happening in my backyard and all of our backyards and that neighborhood so or anyoneLove isn't very well Cloud could it's not like we don't know where they're all apps, but when it's like what are the chances they're going to end up at my house, but one little lie, there's a major event klusterfuk clearly.It could happen.It's here.exactlyYeah this time with that.I don't feel that this time.I felt good that they were around but I just can't put it into words.It was surreal.It was beyond or suddenly there would be a commotion at one of the houses around us where they be surrounding the house yelling to my peoples come out bizarre.I don't know why those houses usually the people that would come to our some white old ladies that just drives home that he could be hiding anywhere here.Right, right and really where he ended up is.Yeah.It's weird that only accentuated how was already feeling so now Everything feels really weird and discombobulated.It's just strange going back to our routines.I guess all in all I'm doing okay, but yesterday I was like, wow, do I need to see doctor Carlton again?Maybe do I have some kind of low-grade depression going on even before all this happen?I wasn't feeling awful, but I just I'm just so tired.Yeah, it's funny because last night Kelly came over and we just hung out at home.It was really nice, but I don't know what it is.I just it's like there's a part of me that just wants to reach tree and just wants to be alone.I just don't know.Or will I hurt her?Because right now there's something in me that feels a little bit Reckless like flirting with other girls.There's something in me.That's whatever.Yeah, I don't know.I just feel drained.My appetite is back, but I just feel off.probablyWell, I did have one of those moments Friday when they came and they said how are you doing when I lock the door.That was the one time I just completely broke down.Yeah, yeah, you know it was good or I think there was another time when I was petting Cecilia or something.Yeah throughout this whole thing.I did have moments like that where I cried there will always be more good people.I'm so proud to be from here.I don't know any of I don't know of any hate crimes so far or just in general people opening their homes or giving people rides or whatever.It might be.It's amazing.Even the law enforcement as much as I don't like cops in this case.God bless them.Unbelievable.I think the problem though is this just highlights and build up the exit essential stuff that I feel it's just all absurd and random things happen.It's overwhelming.No, definitely.No, no.No, it's not a life is meaningless saying it's more I think just the Melancholy in us.That's exactly it that's not meaningless.But that very absurd some senseless thing happened and they hurt people and you never know when or where or who it's going to be.And then today is the commemoration of the Assyrian genocide.That's so funny.You normally to me, it's likely my it's like my dad.I just think about it.And anyway, you don't need one day to come right commemorate millions of people but there is something ironic about happening in chest higher.It's weird.Oh, yeah, it brought up lots of things, you know in a way.It just shows that life is sure.It's more like trying to beat the clock the shit that I'm juggling and trying to get done.It's justYeah and relationships.I don't know.I don't know what to make of it Kelly and I hung out Sunday.We went to Mystic when I'm with her.It's great.But also, I don't know what to make of some of my superficial feelings.Like I wish you were skinny.She's very pretty but I don't know there's that I'm a little confused.I'm just confused.It definitely feels like a rollercoaster.Now, you know what, I mean, like earlier today.I was feeling good and now I feel like shit.Probably coming here.There's just so much.I was walking around it was beautiful outside.I had a nice walk with Kelly to get coffee and I'm sitting here I Feel That Fire and it's in a little bit of sick in my stomach a little headachy.Yeah.and the funny thing is that I knew that thenot that was happening even before like when the bombings happen.I knew that something triggered.It's just like what the fuc the only two things I keep telling myself is that one?It's not just me.It happened in a whole neighborhood and number two.People died in those families people are named.anda number to at least I have this one to come to also this is an opportunity to instead of becoming so disassociated.That's where work can ground you.I just have to find a way to regain some energy right now.That's what it is.I just feel like I have no energy.I just feel kind of sick.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, yeah, right right.I've been in mining myself of that too.That's where I was trying.That's what I was saying.I'm actually handling it better thanYeah, like you said I'm just kind of waiting to feel those things instead of telling myself those things.Right.I'm trying not to be so hard on myself.Nothing specific.I was all over the place.I don't know.I was thinking on the one hand what sucks now is I'm full of anxiety.But what is the next thing that's going to happen?Like what's the next bad thing that's going to happen.Today I was like I could try to write about this but then of course I was thinking yeah.Well, that's what I say about a lot of things and then I don't actually do anything.I'm not doing it.Yeah, I know.Not really.It's a curse to be so ambitious and must be nice to just not be as much I have all these things on my plate.No one put them there.I am paying them there, but I can't help it.You know that comedian Margaret Margaret Cho.Do you know what I'm talking about?She has a thang on salon.com.Children why she's ambivalent and she's pretty sure she doesn't want them.There's one really good part towards the end where she's like in the end.I don't think what it is is that I don't want to love anything.Much and I've something that I know is in me.I don't want to I was like, wow, that's such a simple way to say it.I know exactly what she's talking about.There's something reverse Leaf ring and not going there completely.I think she even says something like not letting something that much even myself.I was like, yeah that makes perfect sense.rightOkay, 12:30.Alright.Thanks.See you.So I've been fairly anxious this week about a few different things.I've been working on the same paper for the last couple months.It's sort of been my big paper that I want to talk about and job interviews.So I've been trying to finish it before I send out applications, but I need to both send out applications because I need to have a job and I also because there's sort of like I'm anxious about there where we will be.I can understand that uncertainty.I don't really like I feel like I've been putting her in a position of uncertainty for a while and the concerns are there.So I finish that paper Sunday, which is a good thing, but it's sort of anxiety attached to will I ever finish this just to get it done already.So I'm already in likeTo the job portion of I feel like I have to find the right job, you know on one level so that my wife doesn't kill herself and I'm on another level but I'm happy somewhere for the next couple years on another level so that I pick the right ones so that I have a career that I want even though.I don't exactly have a know what for your I really want it matters what I do next.And then in to the actual production process of sending out applications, I'm I think I mentioned that in chemistry almost all the post office ocean want to send applications to people so you noted that I like to construct rules to govern my environment or something that particular feature is a strengthened some areas when there is actually acting position for a job.I write an application that indicates why I would be a good match for the position when there is no posting.I know that the person who is reading it will still have a set of criteria.Well, I have no access to what these prices are really are.So I have the sense of what I have to say the right thing.I have to explain like how I would be a good fit for this position that may or may not exist based on criteria that I have not have no access to so I can I find that nerve-wracking.There's a sense in which all of it is.Okay, it's hard to deal with it and it makes me feel less efficient the work that I'm doing.I'm like, I just need to get through it and it's okay.Did you finish your paper?I can get things done.I'll get the application done probably today or tomorrow and I'll be sending them out.Sitting here looking for a good seat.Another thing about I've been anxious about a sort of where we left things last week.There's been less pressing in several days last several days, and I've been pretty much more anxious about other things.Certain things have been on my mind also.So there that's your series of questions not really related to each other.I don't want to come back to the last two at a moment's but start with which one you go.From oversea Reebok that it I'm sensitive that particular thing.So I asked if this was your first pregnancy and you sort of that moment in which disengage from directly asking a question and started I felt like harvesting more defensively you were more reluctant to answer some questions.That is that I believe that you were more reluctant to answer that.I could be wrong in that we recognize that this is the premise under wish I was operating here.We talked a lot after I asked about that Aunt why I'm so curious about your pregnancy.And so I can send you the thing about that question.I think there were several things going on.Like I said a big snarl of things here.So just trying to keep talking and see what will get.So I think the two things that I don't remember talking exclusively about our one I really want to have a family.So in a sense you have this thing that I pretty much want in don't really see how I'm going to have because I don't really I just don't I really get used to want to have children with Tanya and addition to wanting to have children.Not sure what I want to have if I want to have children with Tanya.I don't know if she can handle it.I don't you know, so there'sBut I feel like there's maybe a sense in which I'm trying to appropriate your pregnancy, which sounds horrible.I'm sorry if it is potentially a thing, but I'm doingLike take a piece of it or something for myself, which is why it sounds horrible to me.I think another piece that's going on most of the women in my life one way or another are are having pregnant.That's just sort of like both of my sisters are pregnant and have them pregnant.One of them is pregnant right now went into labor recently over the weekend is an in labor anymore.So another nice in a week or so, probably which is wonderful.I'm excited about it.So I just have a clear sense that it's not an easy thing but it hasn't seemed to affect you at all in terms of your work life, which is great.I think I can only assume speaks your ability to like keep yourself separate and safe.But there's this sense I have I think that this is must be a challenging for you because it's challenging for everyone else I've done so I feel like I'm trying to say it's okay for it toI don't need like you're going away on maternity leave like there's a reason they have maternity leave because like, you know, it's an important fit.No, no, I I mean that's in my mind.We have this maternity leave because one needs maternity leave after childbirth in order to recover relate to the child take care of the child's needs all so we have some social social algae accommodation there.So it's sort of like it's not a secret but it's hard I guess is the other is how it it was related.I think there's also the sense that one of the things I'd like to do in my other relationship is he aware of things that people are struggling with and sort of offer to talk with them in about them sort of tell them that I understand this is going on.So I think that I'm trying to do that and realize our relationships very different from my other ones, but I think that I'm doing that other ways.So I think that's part of it.I think those are like the important things.I'm glad to have them said and thought aboutI think they're important but none of them none of those or any things of the other things many things that I've said on this topic actually get the how did it come to be the case that I asked the question.It's all related because I do have all those things but I actually how it came to be is some long time ago.I asked you whether this would be your first child.And you said it would be your first biological child.So a couple weeks ago, I sort of and then I raised a question very carefully to avoid asking the question that I then later asked you like I did that because anywaySo a couple weeks ago, I sort of talked as if this were your first pregnancy and in so harvesting you you inquired as to why I would think that was the case and you were curious about that and I sort of responded very quickly that you had told me even shortly after that but the reflecting later it's really not what you are told me.Why what you're told me is that this is your first child because that's what I had asked deliberately went on to the question.And so I felt like perhaps it I had been dismissed very real and very trying struggles of yours and don't really don't want to have done that.And so I asked a question believing that it was likely that becoming pregnant has been a challenge and has been hard like a traumatic thing and other times for you because I wanted to I guess apologize for dismissing that so that's how it came to be.That's a good question.Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for the messing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case, that's about as far as it went.Like I don't sort of like I sort of like if I accidentally stepped on your foot when I was walking in here.I might say did that hurt and then I would apologize for stepping on your foot.Normally.I would probably just apologize because I'm sure it would hurt but like if I weren't sure I might ask first like a crappy metaphor forWhat I think was going on.I was actually want to know but it's like I also recognize that it's a level of knowledge about you that I have no reason to expect you would want me to have and I'm really okay with that, but it's the idea that I have unintentionally stepped on you that led me to ask that question.Part of my anxiety comes from the sense that my and asking the question feeling like you sort of pulled back at that moment as if we were likes shock over shocking question and perhaps you much as if I had like in trying to fix something and I felt like I had done badly or yeah, that's pretty close.I don't know another thing I had to ask too much or something.So I'm going to move on to the other questions now.I asked you I think at the end of last session that had you ever been suicidal and whether you would lie to me you were struck by the pairing of this questions.Rightfully, so particularly with some of that was the time constraints and some of that was that like having the sense.I've asked this question that you don't want to answer trying to give you enough other questions that you couldn't possibly answer all the questions so we can both pretend that you didn't avoid any particular.I'm still has to keep on for another question that you have more so it'sSo I asked so that you I asked him which clear because I had been thinking I think the day before I ask them like so I'm anxious about asking those questions for you know, the reasons about me not like asking too much for you those questions.I sort of was wondering are there any questions to which the answer my fundamentally change my view of who you are or my view my experience or my understanding of you and those were the two had you ever been suicidal?Obviously, my wife has been for a while and that has changed radically my view of first I find myself unable.Although it's not strictly.Correct the trustor unwillingly hard.Unwillingly certainly hard and so in a sense in which to answer that question has been possibly to shake me in Sunday way.Either you with you say yes, if you say yes, either my relationship you will change in a way internally or I will still a certain way or I won't and I don't and then that means something about my response to Tanya.It seems like an important question to at least talk about this part of what we're doing seemed important.I don't actually know how much it matters what the answer to the question is.And I think well, it's vaguely related.It is a lot of ways related to my friend Francia.If something is too uncomfortable for him.He just would lie to my face and I'm kind of okay with it and I'm kind of not really okay with it.I don't have I guess my feelings on that sword out.So I think that's sort of how that question came out.I don't have an actual specific to the CERN on that question.So I haven't told you what would happen.If you said yes, would you if you had Siri on what would happen to me?Give me an answer you thought I needed rather than the true answer was part of the question would you lie to me?So I guess it has two parts to it.Would you want to harvest more Harvest?But I'm done.Those are all the things that I traced out to present.Are you willing to say anything more about what you mean by you didn't like the question?Okay.Okay.I'm actually trying to help my wrap my head around what you said like just internalized it.It seems to be slow or something in this is with contacts.If I'm understanding correctly your internal response to the question made you question their approach to which you and taking so you change your approach.All right.I actually had nothing else other thanI have read one of those books and liked it.So.curious incident of the dog in the night-timeYeah.I think I have the sense of that one of the ways that people get through life is by sharing the joys and their sorrows with people.Normally I can I have Pasadena Terry a lot of things to sort of Carrie other people sorrow it helps.I like to I like to help people.I think that's sort of I think that's all I have are just thoughts.I think part of it is that most people not necessarily me but most people are sort of tell you or any arbitrary person things that I wish they were excited but won't necessarily say the things they're excited about that have been hard.That's where I think this is sort of the idea that being aware of somebody else's troubles in his important thing because may or may not be like coming out with it.They're almost certainly don't want to talk about it.At least a little bit having to acknowledge that this is hard or exist.There's there are probably a lot of other ways to tackle this metaphor, but those are my first responses.No, I think not with me.I feel like it must be something you want to do.But you know your talk about taking care of yourself and having a good sport not working those imply you do these things and that was sketchy response, but it covers the whole area.Almost sounds like I don't have any real sense that you ought to be like.Rely on me when I share these things freezing that seem sort of absurd but I felt like I talked many times about how strange it is for me to be in a relationship.Like I share all of these intimate things and now myself like you here, perhaps occasionally mentioned passing and good things in my life, but mostly I talked about bad things you're so it's like one way our relationship is skewed and then another is like you just don't talk much about yours when the struggles over the last several weeks if I feel like it has been trying to me for me trying to take away the barriers to intimacy that I have made so that the ones that remain are natural and some sense of the ones that you're supposed.You aren't supposed to like the ones that I've made for you or wanted or something.So, I guess I want to express some uncertainty.About how I don't know.It's not for me to know like what you do don't want to share.It's part of exploring or growing or developing the relationship that we have whatever exactly it is.Yes, I feel like I sort of said more or less that I had said on the subject.I want to say yeah, you're hearing me correctly.That is a thing.I've been thinking about Emma's part, but I guess it's not sufficient prompt to talk about it further.Is that an okay thing to say?I'm sorry.What's the accident?No, I actually think that you being pregnant is good thing.I'm very happy for you and hope that things will be good for you.And it sounds like it's giving us an opportunity to talk about these things.So thank you for that particular way of phrasing it, but I don't think so.Actually thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you're pregnant.You know that always brings me out this question.Why are you here?Why do we do this?Like what what?Yeah.Yeah, you know one of the other things that and all of this is I feel like I'm trying to work out these issues that I have with I'm working in them out that you or something.I feel like about to be challenging or something to you.So particularly and you shifting how you respond to it.I feel more anxious about it.But you having said what you said I sort of I guess I understand it better that there is no particular talking about my fears of being put off so and I'm sensitive to changes in the world around me of any kind cuz you're killing other people who knows why I just soThere's something that plays into my mind praising internships there.I feel like I'm asking a lot, but you need to not be willing to give I appreciate that you.See me at all but it's also making extra time for me here.Even though I am who I am I guess or something.Yeah, I think that's right.Yeah, that's right.Okay.Right now, I'm great.It's been a terrible week.Well, I'm not a terrible weeks sleep wise, but it sounded very good week.I've made me go running this morning with the dogs.So I feel pretty good right now.Yeah, I've kind of been wallowing this week.We didn't get great news from the doctor my friend left.He had a bad shock with his mom.I was just kind of sucked into such an incredible week.Can you keep having things that felt like they were going to get me out of it?Like I gave a talk at school and I was really fun and I got really pumped and then I came home and we are supposed to take his mom up for dinner and he had tried to go out to Staples by himself and like so like he was out of control walking so that kind of killed it everyday.I felt like I was going to do a push through something would happen and I just couldn't cope.It's funny though.I didn't feel anxious or have trouble sleeping.I just kind of felt depressed.Yeah, it was just funny because it didn't make me stuck and I pretty much just kind of made me not want to do anything.I slept.Yeah.Yeah, I slept more and his mom had brought me like six chocolate bars for Christmas and I ate chocolate and while which is not the best.I guess.Yeah, I mean, I'm a little run this morning.I decided it's better than what could have happened last year and I think it has mostly because Josh was a reason.I wouldn't say he's happy but he's not miserable.He's kind of acting choppy or guy.I asked him why he was so happy.Yeah, and he said I don't know because I think he's got more perspective.I don't know.He just seems happier.Well, so he got cardioverted on Tuesday, and they said that his heart was like four times the size.It's supposed to be which renew but it basically hasn't gone down at all.And if I had come down then there would be like hope so that's kind of not much.Hope that that will continue to happen.Probably out of the doctor said it's one of the biggest party scene.He said he probably has a genetically large heart.He's an athlete which makes your heart really sick.So there was extra stuff to stretch out or something all kinds of unlucky think so and then they put them on he got really badly and not really badly burned but they gave him a lot of electricity this time and he got a really bad burn and they kept him a couple of nights like he couldn't sleep because he has a giant on his back.And in fact, I don't know what exactly is going on.He's been acting so funny this beat the second day after he came out of the hospital.We were driving home from the pharmacy or something and he was like, I want your parents to come over if you call them up and have them come visit.I was shocked.I was like really you're actually asking people to come hang out.So I called my parents up and they came over the next day and he made them all sooner.So that was really good so I can spend Emma helped me a lot despite the fact that I was still vomiting.So, I don't know what's really good.So we were kind of Designing.It's much better than it could have been now after dragged out of my wall away.My friend has been like just sending us emails about her new life all week and how wonderful and easy does Linnaeus pictures and I don't know.I'm so jealous of her.I mean I did that for three four five years ago, and it's so exciting and full of Dreams full of energy at just going going damn.I was extra bummed out because she was with us long enough that she witnessed.I think a few days before she left Josh.I don't know what he did took too many drugs and eat enough, whatever.He got really nauseous and nearly puking in the bathroom for a few hours and you know, she saw thatshe's all set to know enough to see before and I told her most of the things that there were to tell.Her and she responded unlike anyone else has like, you know you and I talked to her unlike Josh who we talked about most things how I feel and how he feels probably more about how I feel it's always go and like extra stuff that comes along with the conversation, but I don't know she just completely understood whatever I was saying and still seem to think that we were amazing and wonderful people and had a great life.So that was that has that was has disappeared.And the day we took her to the airport.We took her I like 5 in the morning and we didn't get much sleep and I figured I'd just get you no have a day is started really early and I was destroyed all day.I don't know if it was the exhaustion.It was sad.He I was just a terrible day and then at night Josh had a talk with his mom and it was a really painful conversation to listen to I'm not sure he didn't even talk to me about it.He was like, I'm going to go talk to her right now.Yeah, I heard it the whole thing.It was awful and I was thinking I should go over there until he started sort of talking about me kind of in a sideways way.I mean he is a terrible at talking about something like that.His mom is ten times worse.The conversation was one of the most painful thing I have ever listened to and I'm not sure anything came out of him.I mean it didn't end badly it just kind of ended uncomfortable.Immediately came and asked me if she had gone.On a good job.Like I don't know the two of you may have said something without meanings you like.Are you my computer jumped we may have had said something to that meaning to like I want you to be taken care of when you're old and not be a burden kind of like I don't want your problems some sort of two things and he try to fix it.But I ended up asking her if she wanted us to take her out for dinner a few days later for her birthday, and she clearly was like, I don't know if she was offended by that conversation but said, oh no, no, no.No, you don't have to do that.And then he likes said he didn't actually take her out for his birthday.We didn't take her out because she like could even walk to Staples.And she still barely shows any concern about it, and it's just a mess.So anyway, I couldn't handle all week.Yeah, they also they gave him an extra drugs to lower his heart rate even more and if it goes blowing up, there is like a built-in Peacemaker that your heart will kick in and he kind of has it naturally because his heart rate is so low, they call it become junctional rhythm.And he woke up in the middle of the night feeling like he had just been shocked the second night.And that was really scary and didn't call the doctor and I was like, oh my gosh take less drugs.So and again no, but I think about it.He's been dealing with it fairly.Well, I just kind of I got a haven't been too rough on him been bummed out about it all I don't know.Yeah, and I don't know what what happened to those feelings of wanting to run away.I don't feel like that what is really confusing?We also my friend other doctors appointment and which I asked him and this is not the doctor who did all the procedures.This is a regular radiologist who gives him mostly medication and so he's not the person to ask but he said that in his opinion if this does not hold then there's really nothing more to do so just deal with it.I don't know.They pushed the pacemaker before it didn't bring it up yesterday.Maybe he just didn't want to go there.I don't know Josh I talkin to him about stem cell trials and I thought he was kind of out there but the doctor was like sure I don't know.I mean it won't kill him yet right now.He's still healthy and strong enough that it won't kill him unless he has an extreme truck or something.Yeah, it's a big rest, but that's what he take some of the medication that he takes.Yeah, it's manageable for.I don't know.I mean the doctor going to answer those questions.I'll have to see the other.The surgeon he can tell us more than yeah.Yeah, I mean it really feels I feel terrible that I really go out like this.This is hard and Josh seems to be in a better place about it.No, I don't know why he's not as affected by me.I mean, I've also just been pressured this whole week that my friend leaving and him being in the hospital even a happy mood.I mean, it's just like I can't keep myself together.I don't know.I don't know what it is.It just frustrates me constantly, like giving this talk and having my lab really supportive who I gave the talk to you and you know, I even had somebody come in and asked me if I wanted to before I was just really really supported of it.I was just like jazz crazy Jazz and how he was sorry that he is.I don't know anyone else who gave a talk my friends think I'm nuts my lab mates, butWell speaking in front of people at school.I get Jazz for men.Oh, yeah in a room full of people like laugh because I said something silly and I'm just like I get so happy then after I started thinking about how this is a problem in my personality and I wish it wasn't this way because some people are sad I get depressed or sick.Sorry.It makes me feel crazy.I don't need other people to drag me out of it.Well, if someone making me go.I used to be able to do that.I used to be much better at pulling myself together.I was in control of everything because I don't have a boyfriend or dogs or crazy boyfriends mother.Whatever.Or family or anything, but I'm sure if I was alone again, it's gone now.It's been ruined so which is why I was so jealous of my friend who she's gotYeah, and I hope that she never loses that I hope that she keeps it forever.Yeah, I mean if I say stuff like this to Josh and he just tells me I'm being silly and you know, we could be in a much worse places.But again, I told him that doesn't help me and it makes me feel worse that I have feelings like this at all when people are having some kind of hard or something.rightdirections to tell me that you can't really succeed as an athlete unless you've had a rough childhood and learn to overcome difficulties.I used to get so mad.Maybe it's true.Maybe you need to have something terrible happened to you when you're younger and you can cope and maybe a truancy more.I don't know.Not at all.Well hisnever there's more cost learning it now than there would have been.In high school and you know, I have to keep my life going unless I go back to my parents house and live in their basement.No.Yeah, I mean I could have more so just as idea of why I needed to have a bad childhood to be happy is that you can push through suffering and suffer a speed cyclist.They say if you stop her for hours and hours and hours.It was just a New York Times article about athletes you get really really injured and thrown out of their spa and how it ruins their lives.I think Josh was actually really happy or even was it yesterday.Yeah.Well, I mean really bad injury is like you're paralyzed or something.They have no more friends.Their friends are all still in Spore and don't want to be around them because it reminds them what could happen to them and so on and so forth It's really was depressing.There was no good ending to any of the stories five or six of them couldn't I couldn't keep reading it.I mean there were several stories of cyclist who have died of heart problems, mostly because of drugs and doping when their hearts explode or something, which is awful.I think you fell validated yetyeah and I guess that's why I'm so happy about cheese I mean you let this girl in to see what was going on and I don't know what it is about my family that he feels so comforted byYeah, it's really nice.So maybe he is trying to corner.I don't know.Yeah, if you could get it friends.If I could get a friend another one.Anything?Yeah, I mean, it's also talk like you find such a Solas in my family that can drive me nuts.We are going to visit them a week ago with my friend.Also my dad.He's done this a few times like you was telling my friends LP about how hard it is to watch his kids how relationships and how scary it is and how terrifying it is for him as a father and you know, he's around the other side of me from her.This is like when he told my friend did I ever tell you about this?You told my friend that he thought that Josh was going to die last year when we were out to dinner.Last January I was having a horrible time.I may have just before or just after having run away for some.Of time.I don't know exactly but I force myself to go meet my parents and a friend of mine for dinner and I think it was right after Josh's.Appalachian first one so he was in bad shape.I was in terrible shape and he said to my friend next to me that you know, she was worried that Josh was going to die.Didn't say it to me or talk to me about it you guys to my friend and then my friend was like freaking out to me on the way home asking me why you would say that to her and how upsetting it was so then he base we did a similar thing recently.And I know he's not terrified about my brother's relationship.There's nothing terrifying about that.I mean maybe he thinks about it, but the only one not terrified of relationships, soNo, he can't talk to me about it at all.Not at all.It's terrible.It's awful.I'd like him to be supportive and he could tell me that he's like worried butYeah, I mean it basically implies that he does not want me to be doing this which is fine if he talks to me about it.I don't know.Yep.I keep waiting.Yeah, Josh, when he had the procedure done before and after she is so anxious.I mean, he stares at the monitor just waiting for a Star to go with them which is reasonable because sometimes it does, you know, you wouldn't eat anything after he got his last procedure done just in case he went out of prison so that he could do it again just in case and this can't be though.We need to keep in there for like an hour or so.I can't be good for your recovery or anything.I keep teasing her about how we both should go to meditation and I'm kind of wondering if we really should because this week he hasn't been walking around staring at his heart looking depressed.I'm not sure why exactly actually but he gets into a.Of doing that.Is he?Yeah, actually he is it's hard to think about how we could actually do it in our crate are crazy house and what would actually need to happen?Yeah, there is one in the Square.It would be at night for him to go out at night.It would beWe have something to do that exercise.That was something relaxing that was not watching TV and eating chocolate which is what we end up doing.Yeah, well wings.Use of coffee every time he has one of these things happen for a little while.And so I thought he might want to go out and have coffee with me the other day and like he could get sea or something and he wouldn't go out to the coffee shop.I don't know you can't take that away from us with nothing left to do.No, you just have a lot of fun together.Just hanging out, but it becomes a problem after a week because of his problem.Yep, you lose all perspective and get depressed even with going to school at still and he's not going to go back to school for a while this semester.He is going to be mostly working on a thesis or she'll be at home a lot and we will really do we really do need something.Have you done restorative yoga?I think I could get him to do that over the medication.He doesn't do well with sitting like in a total silence around other people.What's restorative yoga discipline you line the dark?Maybe we'll try that.Yeah, he get those are going to regular yoga classes.He feels like it's a competition that he can't do anything and everyone else around him is doing he has kind of worked up about it.Seattle say things like that.Sometimes they'll be like, okay, it's playtime around your handstands.End up feeling bad about himself every time.And it can't be heated or if you like start getting nauseous.He also has trouble kind of like when I do if I am kind of not feeling good and I play too much attention to my body that I must get a little depressed andaccepting the idea of going to a meditation center is going toI've got to do those.I mean, he's been spending so much time looking up the trials worrying about I mean he had an eye twitch and is afraid his electrolyte levels were off.And unfortunately, he said the Doctor Who clearly also is a hypochondriac like oh, yeah.I had an eye twitch to you in a medical school in my wife's an optometrist.So who needs the stress that was funny, but I think I got more stress fromwell, I meanThings that he's trying all the supplements.He takes all the stuff he does.He doesn't try to make himself calm.Yap and Layla he tells me that which is always nice to cure.Well, right.I mean last year none of this happened.I want to like go out to do anything and she was depressed.Yeah, it is.Yeah.I hope that things are continuing to improve very slowly.Oh, that's why I'm sorry.at 3:30Morning, I'm at a loss as to what to talk about again.Although I think in a better way this week in general.I feel better this week than I have for the last couple of weeks.That is a good thing.The classes are not immediately obvious, but I think some of it feeling like I have been telling people that I'm upset and trying to deal with that in I guess different drugs fashion.I don't know.Yeah, I'm not sure where to begin.So it's a strange thing, not know what I'm asking to consult with you on but that's where I am.Okay.Well, thanks.That's helpful.Yeah, sometimes I'm not sure what what thread is important to pick up this week.I guess my parents are coming to visit this weekend.It's probably a good thing.We have a very small apartment.So I'm concerned about hosting my parents in our tiny apartment.It's they have a house that's large enough for 7 people that live in and our use it.Are you living in that space and it's a different thing.I didn't tell him visited me since I was in college in Texas, so it's an interesting and different thing.I was in Ohio for 4 years and after a couple of years, my mother decided that she might want to visit instead of just me coming back to visit which in a lot of ways made more sense me visiting home because the rest of my family is there it's one person far away and six people relatively close the direction of travel make sense for me to be going back home.But that's what my mother decided she wanted to know what I was doing and was curious where I was and all of them know here in Andover that's not really going to happen because I was doing all the actual work.Now I'm sitting here.So I was thinking about how good a question that was that you asked.It seems to get you a lot of issue.I think they haven't visited before and so to a large extent.I have no idea what to expect.I think we discussed that generate some anxiety for me.I think it's generalized.It's no particular thing that I'm worried about other than there's no particular thing.I'm worried about.Just a general feeling of unease about it.I think there's a sort of a sense of Hosting responsibilities hosting then that comes with sir and sort of make sure everyone has a good time sort of goals or requirements or something.I'm not particularly clear how to do that in this context.Not that my parents are hard to please.That's the silly part of it.It's like the ridiculously easy going for the most part and if they're bothered they are not going to tell me so it'll be okay.And they're coming explicitly to see us and to like help the care of us in this difficult time.So it'sso I think that's going to be okay.Over the weekend and I guess until Monday 20th seem to be getting a little more sad and sleeping more and kind of strange and I found out Monday that she had run out her Synthroid or synthetic thyroid hormone.I think I think I stopped taking it Friday or before so why do I don't know or think that that is like a primary driver of her depression and just all of the turmoil or the last couple of years.She didn't have a greater and part of her thyroid removed and has been doing thyroid suppression therapy since about the time we got married so it fits right into the same time under as everything else.This is one of the things where we talked about some we talked some about my difficulty difficulty with what is she responsible for and what is she not?This is the thing that I feel like she is a very responsible for and that is like perfectly under control you go to the doctor you get things checked you take the medication until you just take maybe think about it a little bit and assess whether you're doing reasonable things with your treatment in that regard and make sure that he stays stable.That's it.And that's the thing that she's done fantastically poorly at and just continue to do poorly at in some sense.Like I don't know whether she does not understand that after 3 days.She only has only 70% or less of the thyroid hormone in her system or what?No, because she already feels guilty about not having gotten the medication and so like I intend to ask her but the problem with exponential decay is like impulse treatment.It's easy to drop off very quickly after a week.She would have half or less of the hormone and her sister but it takes a long time to build back up.And so if this is actually contributing factor talking about it particular when I'm kind of angry about the fact that she has failed to do this simple thing again, because we've talked about getting her thyroid medication before we talked about how I went and got her thyroid medication like three months ago because she didn't have it is not seem like a good idea at the time so seem like not an important issue to confront in this specific moment because she was already going to get it and that dayUntil she I found out she wasn't getting any so it wasn't I did not need to do anything to get her to get it.It was just a why on Earth have you not been doing this?And I don't understand how one feels to do errands like sometimes you get busy.Sometimes you don't feel like doing whatever particular are and I get that but this is not an errand of the same magnitude as getting butter or something.Fair enough.There's also something which I don't like.Yes.This is the thing.She's failed to do several times.She doesn't remember all the other times.She's failed to do they at least nine.Sorry, I wasn'tYes is the things she's failed to do several times.She doesn't remember all other times.She's failed to do it.At least not in the last several months.So like me being upset about this as part of a trend is not useful or perhaps not even a fair thing.It's certainly not a thing that I think it's worth bringing to the discussion to have in an emotional sense enough actual sense.It is important to know that is the recurring problem, and maybe we need a different solution then wait until you have run out and get a few days later.Bye.I mean we talked since when Tony was here that she has a hard time handling me being upset.And so like I am concerned that me being angry is going to impact or negatively but in a dangerous way.I don't know.I don't know.It's sort of makes sense.It sort of makes it easier to justify like behaving in this fashion.I'm not sure that that's actually that I don't know.And I'm not always as worried about the implications and a diary way as it was this time.I thought she was doing particularly poorly.But I like this is back into it.If my guess is about the thyroid issues is correct and she is in the more unstable place in the specific moment.And so it's like so yes, the concerns are more dire.Then I guess I feel like you made a statement and I mostly agree with the statement and so I'm not sure what to say in response.Yeah.I think that's an accurate assessment.It does not feel particularly free to say that I found this upsetting not that I can completely hide from her when I find something upsetting butYeah, I mean, I don't know what to do about it.Now I feel like you're pointing to this thing I'm saying.Yes.That seems like about the right thing.Yeah.you know we can spend time talking about that more but I'm not sure what further description of the problem will do if we both already grasped what the problem is, or maybe the point is I don't fully grasp what the problem is, butYeah, and this is a big case.It wasn't so much likeIt wasn't so much that I thought that she was suicidal in the moment.And that anything I said my push over the edge, but it certainly has a subjects related to my behavior in this time.So it's more thanso part of it is that since she's already made that or is about to make the call.To get the prescription refill There's no practical value in asking.Why did you do this?Because she's already fixed it and some cents or as much as it is possible to fix it at that point.And so there is no immediacy to the discussion even to happen in about time.She already feels guilty.I'm bad about not having done it and I feel angry and that's only use what kind of combination of emotions for us to have the conversation.And so if I were to wait for a little while before bringing it up again, I can be less angry and she can be less guilty and maybe we can actually have a conversation in which the in which the likes box or piece that she has to do with it in a more timely fashion can be discussed.It's also conversation.She really doesn't like having she really doesn't like it when I suggest that this I have watched this thing impact your mood.That's a good question.I think it's just a piece where she feels like someone else can notice it, but she should have noticed.I think there's a piece where she has had plenty of people tell her.Oh, you should try this secure your depression.You know, like when I had a headache I took some Aspirin you had a migraine you should take some aspirin also and that's with an LG and it doesn't she has a particular I read about that class of discussion and I think any suggestion of this is a thing that is contributing to your mood to have some emotion.I think so.Yeah.Yeah, that was I was attending to give reasons not to have that conversation in the moment when I'm angry and she has like in that moment.Your first qualifying statement was not commenting on the time scale.These are reasons to have that conversation and that sounds right.and I guess now we're at the point of needing to talk about the time scale because I thinkYeah, I think you're right that those are interesting departure points for conversations.There are stations back.We haven't been able to have the way we would have two or three years ago and more recent.My day is like in the last 4 months, but that's because there has been a sense in which the Tonya I would have those conversations with hasn't existed in the last several months.There's a sense in which she really is there again, so yeah, those are the conversations thatWould be good to have as conversations and not just me telling her that she needs to take the medicine medication.Just very vaguely about the strange place.Our lives are in terms of like how do we get to the place where I'm telling her to take her medication like house?Like how is that like how what would seem like a reasonable motive interaction for us?It's just not.Yeah, it's just not really that's not really a partnership or relationship so much as it I don't know.How do I say?I'm not sure what the word to use butguardianshipMaybe I don't know.I think that's the thing to grow to regain and I really I think that doing that in a normative hiring motion is a way to work toward regaining the mode of interaction.I hate thinking I can't you say that's right.What do I talk about in response to that?And I think the important thing is that I think that it's impacting the way I interact with people and more generally particularly for I think that in a sense habit of rocking my needs is in order to maintain it.I have done it more than just in my relationship with Tanya and it's hard to notice it at first and some sense because I usually try to be a considerate person taking into account the needs of other people.So this and a sense, please directly into a worldview that I have already have and so it's I think it's hard to notice or has been hard to notice thatSure.rainIf it does have to be the case right now or how long does it have to be the case because I don't know that it's really sustainable thing for years.I'm not even sure that's really a relationship again.It works perfectly perfectly together.rightWell, yeah, that's a pretty good mechanistic answer for how we got there.Yeah.Ryan so I try not to do that to avoid that structure but end up in this place and then I'm angry and we're back into it.Like it's a complicated in that way.Yeah.Yeah, so we were visiting our friends last week and you know, occasionally like the question of what you want to do and I found it nearly impossible to answer that question.I always find that something of a difficult question because I feel like my needs needs to be balanced against some sense of group needs which I think comes from having for siblings and having a strong recognition that we all have desires like from an early age.But usually I find the problem like, where's the balance of something like that here?I found unable to identify a particular or desire.Sometimes it's also the case like sometimes I just don't care butBut in this context it seemed or scenes or something.Like I have suppressed that desires to the extent that I can't find them.I don't know.I don't know.It's one of my thinking about this problem of what to do.I want to do next.What is the next step in my career.Really?I have a hard time figuring out what I want, but I do have some desire still like there is a sense in which I really don't want to live in a city larger than this.I'd rather live in a city smaller than this.I can be sort of very clear that I don't want that but it's taking me a little bit of time to recognize that desire or anti desire.That's true.Sure.There is that problem.Yeah.No, it's not a problem.Like the issue is something more like it took me awhile to come to recognize that this is something that I don't want.Although it's really obvious that I don't want that.I'm not that happy living in the city like in a day today since it's just really noisy.And there's nowhere Greener quiet.I read There are trees.So at least there are trees on the street.It's not like parts of Delaware.But yeah, so I don't know where they went, but I can recognize them as they come back or something.Yeah, I don't think I I don't think that I cease to have desires.I think I cease to know what they were but I could be wrong about that.Maybe I just stopped having any desires that I'm not sure at some point.I don't know that it matters like a particular sense that I can't find them so they might as well not exist.And those processes feel similar to me, but they may not be.Okay.Okay.You know, I do a lot of research and so the process of search and the process of research are pretty similar as far as idea the process of coming up with something new in the process of figuring out what is already known.They have some more me some essential similarity.They may not be as similar as I think they are because other people certainly seem to find them very very discreet enquiries.It's interesting for me is like here are the values of what we know.Obviously the next thing to look for is this but if you take away one of those pieces presumably it's the next obvious Beast look for in the cell.Thinking about the shovel the pain that's a good for its contrast and I'd much rather.Tell which is that never existed in which of them existed and cease to be and which are just hidden.Okay.YouTubeI like that chair.I think we have this exact same chair.Oh, I just from the name.How are you?I had another hard week.I just feel like since I've been coming here.I have become more detached.Like I just feel really alienated from Harold.I don't know.It's almost like I just you know, and I just feel really detached.The reason I came was to be more in touch with my feelings and be able to express my feelings.I imagine that's a scary thing for me so protections.Yeah, that's what it feels like.I can definitely okay.I think I can definitely tie it to getting worse than when I'm feeling more discharge, which is why I question whether is it is something similar to I know we talked about work about borderline personality disorder, and I know that they cut to feel something because they feel and I just think there's some of that there because I seem to do more picking when I'm more anxious and attached so it's I don't know I can't I don't want to know if I can say it's better to depend some days better some days notYou know, I think the other thing is the feeling the first feeling that I think I can get in touch with his anger and I don't want to you know, Sheila.I just feel like this whole thing with hair or just has you-know-who up in me for a long time just angry at him not feeling well feeling depressed not enjoying his retirement not appreciating.I feel not appreciating everything due to what the situation is like for me.And so I don't quite know what to do with that.Yes.Yes.Kind of I kind of just accepted it.I haven't really dealt with it.I think I think Harold Express more.He was more in touch with being angry about that than I was.I don't know.I think at the same time I was more concerned about what my mother was going to do.So when it was all happening and then afterwards it was just now I think you're right.Now I want to retire I can't so it is an issue.I guess I'm not totally in touch with that because I also saw the same time that I'm lucky to have what I have and I know there are people that are a lot worse off than I am and I'll manage somehow I may have to work on 80, but I don't I mean if there is anger about that, I'm sure they're probably is I'm not in touch with it at all.I'm more feeling I'm feeling it more I think directed to hell because I feel like he has this opportunity.He's not really enjoying it and appreciating it the way I think I would and I also think that this being that I'm working full-time and he's working part-time and it's you know way less it's two days a week.Well, it's 4 days a week, but hours Wise It's maybe 12 hours a week.I just feel like that should make our life easier because Harold has time to do a lot of things that I'm still doing.I'm still cooking.I'm still doing the food shopping lot of times when I bring it up.He says, you know, why don't you ask me I say, why should I have to ask you?You know, I feel like it's things that has to be done but have to be done the second we both why should I be the one that has to say, you know take the garbage out because it's Tuesday.Yeah, I'm still like, you know, I mean, I guess my image of Harold retiring was that there would be some more time for him to take care of me because or do things that would make our life easier.But you know, he's like going to the doctor's all the time and not feeling well all wonder he basically has been said he saidHe did go to the new psychologist and he did change his medication for depression that he takes he was talkin taking Wellbutrin and something else.They took him off that and put them on Zoloft.So, I don't know maybe that will help.I guess it's the part that whenever anything comes up about something.I haven't done or a negative to me.I just filledLike what I just feel like what about everything I do he says look, you know, I love you.You know, I respect you, you know, I would never do anything.I tried to explain to him that it doesn't matter.But if you do do something even if you don't need it, and it upsets me.I need to be able to give you that feedback and now he would say that's ridiculous.You're overreacting.So I think he heard that a little bit last night.I also think you know that he says my perception is not right really his reception is not right.It's like there's no point in trying to there are times I say, okay.I'm going to write it down on the calendar every day that Harold says that he doesn't feel well every day that he does this every day that he does that I don't do it and that he'll say that's your perception and you know, that's not true, you know, maybe once in a while, I do that.I'm mad at myself that I let the girl talk me into the dog.I like the dog.I don't want the responsibility.It's just another thing for me to have responsibility for.Oh, yeah, I thought about that for a long time.That he is, you know, basically going to be debilitated.He's not going to be able to do anything.Yeah, definitely.Well, I think it's inevitable because he has arthritis all over so he had one knee replaced and the other one needs to be replaced.They won't do it because it was such a bad experience the first time so that's just going to get worse.It's not going to get better Builders really bad, even though he's in physical therapy is seems not getting better.Yeah, I mean and the pain I just think it sucks.Well, I guess part of my Detachment is if I remove myself from it, I can be happy or you know, I can go out with my friends.I can do things, you know, maybe you know, it's just sort of came to me.Yes, it's the Detachment in the sex thing and the more I put an effort into trying, you know, like thinking about it and trying to do something about it the more it's on my mind all the time and basically ends up back burner, you know, so that I'm very where in the last few weeks.I haven't had much physical contact at all.Yeah, how does not understand that?I don't know.If men just don't understand that is serious part of feeling that way is because we're not being intimate.If you would just be more intimate we would be able to handle those kinds of things.But I see, you know, I understand what he's saying, but it doesn't work like that for me.Yeah.I'm just assuming it's that same feeling that I know I've been there.I felt the intensity when I start to get in touch with whatever feelings it is I pushed away and it's just easier for me to probably just you what I've done my whole life from a child.It's easier for me to function and be somewhat together and find things I you know find enjoyment out of flies and without letting my feelings get in the way.I haven't felt in a long time.Actually, it's just something bubbles up and I just can't stop crying.I don't know what it is.I wouldn't jump to say it sad.I think there is a sadness there but it just seems more than that.It's interesting.I was talking to my older sister and she said she is in one of her therapy experience has really gone touch with like this Primal really Primal hurt and sadness and anger.I just remember that one time where I was in therapy and thought that it was possible that I could do this.I just remember leaving their one session and getting it to my car and just being his real and just like feeling like something's really hands and it was just, you know, about to happen.No, it's kind of an aversion.What?Like I don't ya, okay.I also felt that way when I was older and my father would try to be affectionate.He's not wasn't I don't think a very affectionate person but I had the same feeling about the charge.I know.I don't know.I know that I'm very in touch with that point.You know, my kids want me to touch them.You know, I'm just very in touch with how glad that makes me feel?Yeah.Yes.the doctor you meanI can I actually can think of it more with my father only because it was later.I was really young and I don't know what I really felt.I know I had an issue as I got older with my father wanting to do, you know, put his arm around me.Yeah, I could feel the aversion.I didn't feel comfortable.I just didn't feel comfortable with at all.I'm just feeling something right now.I'm feeling sick.I don't know what it is.I guess it feels good to be feeling something.I don't feel it now.It was just kind of anxiety.I don't know.I'm just sad and scared.I don't know something about my father.I think just with this whole thing about potential abuse in July.I just couldn't help but have in the back of my mind to thank you know, that wasn't my father.I mean what if it was my father now?I'm just about to a blank.What?I don't know.What did it look like to you.I don't know.I think somewhere just severe anxiety, which I don't get that often.Feelings there such a way.It's disconcerting to me that I could you know, maybe I'm saying that it wasn't gradual then but I just kind of I just turn it off.Yeah, I definitely know about myself.I think my whole life it was a comfortable place for me to be.I also maybe anger has always been the easiest feeling for me to express.Expresswhy I think anger sometime just makes your real feeling so it's not really a feeling necessarily I think with Harold.It's probably easier than dealing with how sad it is what his situation is what happened to his life.Why cats are also being detached serves my purpose.Well my situation with Harold because I don't have to walk around feeling upset all the time with that Harold is in pain or how old is a happy.He can't do certain things.I know I understand.That's why I'm here I guess.What do you mean?I don't know.I just thought about it and I don't know what made me think of this.But when I worked at Walter Reed hospital it was with with with kids like 12 kids and one of them was borderline personality disorder, you know, you spend your whole life time.They're trying to develop relationships with them.She was obviously very difficult one time.You know, I asked her what was going on and one time she actually told me and it was like, I don't want to know.Okay.Thank you.I will never ask a question again.That's just what came to my mind.I think so.Yeah.It was like I couldn't even believe that anybody could have those going on inside their mind with their feelings.It was scary.Not really scared more like how can anybody live like that?How do you live with all that stuff going on inside?Always my mother was very fragile even now she sees herself as being so self-aware.But it if I think if you ever really got anywhere got really got her to really look inside.I think she would fall apart.I think that's how she got through life is to have the same kind of attachment.She lost her mother.She hated her father because he was cheating on her mother and she blames him for her mother said she had a brother who died.She had a brother who was mentally retarded.He was bitter and jealous of her and Now doesn't talk to her.She knows all the right.I mean she in text intellectually.She's got all the right stuff, but I don't think she has all ever really don't listen to her feelings.She is in some way.She still does it with us, I think about when I'm old I kind of feel fortunate that my mother is so independent and that she doesn't rely on us for you know for a lot.I mean she knows, you know, she knows we love her and we need there in a second if she needed us we go down as often as we can but she has her own life there in California and it's not really part of hours and in some ways, you know, I feel lucky forgot and then in some ways I don't want to be like that with my kids now that I want them to feel like I'm a burden but I would want more of a closeness more exam in my life, especially as I get to you know, as I'm getting older.That's what you have left at this point in your family.Yeah, because that's basically what happened.She just couldn't handle life.She couldn't handle having kids.She couldn't handle it really was wasn't until she got involved volunteer worked just Dells into it.It just changed your life.I think she when she became president of the country County sorry and she was doing speeches all the time and she was you know, I think that she just kind of got lost.Herself and that became a different person.I think if she didn't I but she hadn't had that.I don't know what what happened to her.Yes.Yes.Yeah, yeah.Not consciously in mind I mean not consciously but I'm sure I do.I mean I feel like I've dealt with a lot more at this point in my life.I've dealt with life and things and I'm sure I will be able to deal with whatever it is.It's just I don't know how to get there.Yes.I'm not going to be here next week.I'm going to be out of work then combined with a fun thing.I'm going to Austin for it.I never been to Austin.My friend Gina is meeting me there because her daughter she not working right now her daughter lives in San Francisco and the plan was originally that she would come drive to San Francisco with me so he could so he could meet Melanie but does not off during weekend.So my daughter is coming out to Austin while we're there and then I'll have some free time with them.And then I'm working Thursday getting a car.I can see Melanie.Yes.Yes.Hey, hey.So on Friday, my brother calls me and I don't know he's not doing well.He quit his job.I don't know he was dating this woman who says horrible andyeah, I don't know.I don't know so he's not doing well, but I don't know I talk to you on Friday and he said he just felt crappy all week.But he's a little better.And so and then I guess Saturday, I don't know the same stuff.I don't know.I don't know.I don't know like you just want to company.He been all on all week.I don't know.So yeah, I talked to him Saturday.I don't know I guess on top of everything.I don't know this woman.He was dating.I don't know it was even a tab on the relationship.Pressuring him to pay her.I don't know a couple thousand dollars or something.My brother just turned 27.This one is 41 years old.I don't know.I don't know if she knows about our situation.He doesn't have any money.I don't know he has problems with it.But depression.I don't know just quit his job and he's not feeling too hot right now.I don't know.I guess he didn't tell me the whole story, but I'm sure something happened where she and banded him andShe sent him an email.Basically very rude you owe me this amount or you can sign over the least your car.I'm like what the fuc.I think this is just not that I don't think it's so much.The money is issue is justWe getting how he allowed himself to get into this situation.I don't know kicking him while he's down.I guess I don't know.Yeah, I don't know so he told me he was going out with some of her friends Saturday night.I don't know now.He had called me several times but I didn't get it because I was sleeping.I don't know so it just made me extremely worried about him.I pay for his phone bill so I can go online and see me talk to so I had called a few numbers.I had no idea who I was contacting.I was just numbers I say, this is Stephen sister.I'm worried about him.Would you check up on him a few people I had met I went out there.It was it was a completely random.I don't know I contacted his roommate and stuff, but I don't know.So yeah, I don't know.I don't know if finally get him on the phone again Sunday like noon time.I don't know just feeling really low.I don't know.He actually wants me to call this woman and tell her to back off.I was like, well, I think that will just make things worse if she's serious impossible.It's just the way she was so I was just wait to do that.If you really want me to do it.I don't know.I don't know.I guess there's been a lot of stress and I'm worried.I don't know becauseI know one of his really good friends.I think his name is Ferris.I usually always contacted when I'm worried about 7, but he was out of town.Yeah, I don't know.His roommate is I don't know never got the phone.His phone is always off.So whenever I try to contact him, I'm always I don't know.It's only been ten years later.I don't know.I don't know.I was just like well, we need to make a plan here will get you I don't know how the insurance will get you whatever we'll figure out something and then try to get you some help.I don't know because I think he is not like he hadn't tried several times to see people but just I don't know.What entrance to get a I don't know consultation.I don't know just a lot of prices are outrageous.I don't know.I don't know.I don't know if it's because he's in Miami and they have all these fancy.I don't know recovery centers or something.I was like, there's got to be something else.I don't know.Right.I don't know.I was like, where are you?I don't know looking at I don't know.Yeah, I don't know.So yeah, so yeah.No, I just don't know really what to do because I don't know.I don't know I live far away and I feel like he needs someone to push him a little becausehe is feeling low I don't know I'm getting a job isn't completely I don't know I don't know but we'llwe'll seewell I'm going to I was looking into it I forget exactlythe name of it but it was near Southwest was basically people are finishing up their PHD who needed hours and I think it's you pay on a sliding scale so I told him to look into that you pick whatever you can kind of thing I don't know I thought that would be good because I feel like I don't know I don't know these people would be super eager to help him and they're being advised orYeah, yeah.Yeah, yeah, I don't know I suggested that I don't know.I don't know.I have a plan in my head trying to get him Healthcare so he can if he needs prescription and I don't know he can get some I don't know.We'll see it.I don't know.Other than that.I don't know.I don't know.I probably just like having someone there.I don't know.Baby, do these things?I don't know and also just needs the support of yeah.And I would like for him to move out of Miami, but he needs has to stay there until April 1st because you got a DUI over a year ago and he has to finish up his this contract thing.I guess you leave April 1st or something.But until then it's he has to stay there.I don't know.I am I don't know it's I don't know hard to be.I don't know so worried about something that doesn't not able to directly I don't know deal with it or I don't know so I go back and forth between I don't know if trying to trying not to think about it, and I don't know being worried, but we'll see.I guess if you have any other suggestions, I'll just go across.I don't know counseling.rightOkay.I don't know.I know I got asked to this.I don't know.I don't know.I told my mom even though I'm sure my brother would hate that what's going on and I don't really I don't understand or get what my brother has against my parents other than I don't know.I don't understand that freeze out or whatever.He was doing.I don't know.I don't know.He's just playing them for his situation, but I'm not quite sure.Whenever I asked him, I don't really remember or because it must just not make sense to me.I don't know so my mom's worried and all these other things and she asked about him all the time and I'm just like well, why don't you I'm always like be proactive with just seems to nevernever tell you these things and I don't know flop over and she's like, I just want him to come home and I'm like, well, that's not an option.I don't think that's good for him.I don't know.I don't know.What is this lack of looking into things do things?I don't know.I don't know.I don't know.I don't know but it'sRight.Well, I don't know I think both of those.I'm I don't know Stephen siphoning her the information.I don't know.She always twisted or I don't know or makes it worse or either makes me feel guilty or something.I don't know.I just don't want to deal with it.I don't want to but I I don't know.I don't know.I don't know but I feel like I have to tell her and I feel like I can't I don't know.I can't take this burden alone contacting all these people calling all these friends.I don't know.Where is a it's just I don't know.I want I don't know.I don't know someone or I don't know.Didn't and save the day.I guess.I don't know.I wish you would I mean I know she can't or I don't know but I wish someone was like, okay, look, here it is.This is what we're doing do it.I don't know.She's just doesn't want that or any responsibility to deal with this and I know she can't because she can't talk to Stephen, but I don't know.I don't know.I don't know butI don't know.I don't know.I think I'm just hypercritical of her because she doesn't I don't know she doesn't do anything.I don't know.I'm always like what you do all day.I don't know.So I don't know.I know it's hard and whatever but I don't know.I feel like I don't know and I just feel like she wants to be stuck in these ways.She doesn't want to do with or I don't know.rightI don't know.Right.I don't know.I just because it's just a difference from I don't know my interaction with her or being she was so strong or unwavering or she comes off.Like I don't know.I don't know.I don't know probably like how I come on just blunt or something.I don't know.It's just and then now it's I don't know it's not about sports or I don't know.She's just like doesn't want any part or doesn't know how to deal with it.I don't know.It's just such a difference.I don't know and I don't like I hate talking to strangers.They have to call them on the phone for Tyler.I feel like those aren'tto call peoplerightI don't know.I mean, I guess I'm just I don't know.I don't know.I don't really want you.I don't know.I don't know spend too much time.I don't know thinking about her or when he I don't know blame her or whatever family.I don't know.I need to worry about I don't know other things.We'll see.Right, and then she's not going to change.I'm never going to be happy with that situation or it's not going to be the way I want it.rightI mean I talk to you.I don't know.I mean, I don't think that's true.ButI don't know.I talked to a few of Stephen friends and two of them are older one guy.I talked to you about I've never even heard of but he was in his fifties was actually was stepping on Saturday night.That's how you got his number.It was one of the last ones called and his friend Harris is older as well in his forties.I don't know.And in talking to them they seemed I don't know Proactiv we can do this little and then I don't know people like Marlow and Vicky are very anything that were looking up stuff for going down with me or giving me option.So yeah, I don't know.I don't know.Yeah, I don't know.I don't know.I guess I'm like a I don't know Point person or something.The point person so it's like all right.Here we go.rightYeah.Yeah, I mean it was just like I don't know like a wait-and-see.It's not just like you're all day.And cognitive based therapy.I just know the abbreviation.I don't really know much about.rightrightREII'm not really sure.Yeah.Good night.Hi, so James while I was in the hospital as other than sending out like the daily update to family.And so he sent me he like copy me on sort of the last one yesterday andit seemed to me that was only a lot more detailed than the ones in the past.So like stuff about my psychiatrist.Why?Things that like an like basically said that I would not have chosen to tell my mom for example or James my little brother like I love them but it's not necessarily even that I don't want them to know but I didn't know that they like I didn't know that when I was having a conversation with James that anything in the conversation fair game, which is pretty much how it panned out.So I really freaking about this like great.I mean I don't it's all right.I just sort of a place in iconic like sort of them.Like I'm freaking out man, and I can never take myself.Seriously when I say that word actually.so ISurprising to me and so I was like what it's just you email me a lot more details that I probably would have wanted or whatever in and like I didn't say anything after that because I didn't really have anything to talk.and I was also likeit was like 10 minutes before I was getting into bed.I was checking my emails one last time before I went bad.Then I checked email today and James posted like, you know clearly upset and then before I went to bed he was like I'm very upset at the light at the like education that I did something inappropriate by sending these updates.I was like, well, I'm pretty upset that stuff that I was talking about to my psychiatrist appointment in the in the emails and he's like, there's nothing different than the ones he sent in the last hospitalization, which you were fine with I was like, well, it seems like there's a big difference to me saying between Tanya had a rough day today, but it's feeling better towards the evening or like Tanya is doing well.We'll go.it seems like there's a big difference between that sort of email andand then I was like I'm going to bed.It's not I'm not even sure whether I'm upset with him for sending the email like I'm clearly upset with him for being upset with me for having a problem.I feel like that's just the thing more like I'm really scared and scared and II don't know.I know this is a very kind of interesting thing where I sort of feel like I was against okay shoulders relaxed.Then I'll be like no.No, that's not okay and like again.I don't.I don't know whether I'm like angry about this or just scared or just don't feel good about having like, you know.I don't I don't feel good about having my family like know these things about me and I don't feel good that I wasn't the one who got to tell them about that or got to decide whether they know that I don't feel good, though.like the conversation that I had with James in the last week or so that felt mostSort of intimate and understanding and relaxed and supported you know, and then ending up passing on to other people.That's why I don't feel good.But I'm not allowed to be angry about that like that sucks.So that's what I'm learning.And so when I take the James's mom out, she'll have very much and what would very much are?dryer relationship over 10 years has been like her sort of wanting to be like a mother to me and me sort of liketiptoeing to being able to share things with her and trusting her and a part of this is like she doesn't really understand all of this.It's not that she's really sympathetic, but she doesn't doesn't resonate with her.It doesn't make sense.And so it's in the back of my mind.I'm always like I'm the person who's putting her baby through this horrible ordeal.alienYou know and my mom I know we'll will sort of use this to search further like blur the lines between me and her and say I did this.Thing 2, I mean where exactly the same and I just don't want to have that conversation with her and I tell her why I was in the hospital in the first place, you know, I'm glad that James told her that I was in the hospital because I feel like she had a right to know but I don't feel like she had the right to know all of it.I don't know whether like the time I was in Frederick.It feels like sharing the externals of the situation person internal like I was last time.Think I was not internal parts with James either.We doesn't necessarily see a difference, you know, I was doing UCT.So nobody had access to my interior like that including me.exactlyLakesStart if you like James upset with me because I wasn't successful in my effort not to react in any way until I could access the best way of approaching the situation was I literally had an involuntary.I've read the email and that and like what is it?What is it?What's wrong and I could not answer then.Because he knew I was reading that email.And I feel like that's what's upsetting about.oryou you know, I didn't say that.I was angry with him.I didn't say I was angry with what he had done.I said I was upset about what happened.And that was yeah, actually I didn't say I was upset about what it happened.I had said that like I would have chosen to share much which was not the same thing at all.I feel like my problem is really bottling up emotions.This isn't going to help very much.Yeah.Yeah.I have like a tickle.Yeah.You could.Cy James upset I mean I sort of see it clearly enough that I can't push pass to get to know how I'm upset, but I don't know what to do about.Yeah, absolutely.imagine thatYeah.it's like I'm trying very hard to have both of those in my head at once but like I can't one becausebut we both make sense, but like the one pushes out the other I feel like I can't sort of.you know, I think too hard about like the ways in which it's reasonable for James to be upset and like it's reasonable for him to sort of feel hurt about howI'm giving him a hard time trying to like both take care of me and take care of our family in this way.But if I think too hard about it, then I say well, I'm just a terrible person for being upset in the first place.Yeah, I can't hold it.Which is a strange feeling because the very different from not being able to conceptualize it.like yeahThank you for not explaining to me.How both of those can Beach?Sorry, I've been had a lot of people do stuff to me week.Like yeah, no.No, I got it.So today is Ash Wednesday.Which I don't know how much you know this but I'm not going to church this evening and they're going to take some ashes and put them put them on our foreheads across and say remember that you're just and unto dust you shall return.It's like one of my favourite Services of in the year Ashley, but what is hard because it's been Vision transitional aboutrepent sinner moment andthinking a lot about Sin.And it's virtually impossible for me to do that in a healthy way.Like I just I get swallowed.Yeah, yeah.So, you know.All the times people give up chocolate or something like not eating on Friday.So I decided I was going to stop self injuring myself or stop injuring during lunch.And that's going to be my discipline.I'm not really sure I'm going to make it feels pretty ambitious today.Yeah.It's not really one I can talk about with people people are like what are you giving up for lunch?It's like that's something people actually asked which I don't know.I feel like I'm only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question is.Like they're asking intrusive questions then that would be like a lie.Amelia one of the priests of my visit inI like her a lot.I think she's like really excited like talks about Theology and gets really excited about it.And I do the same thing.It'slike if that's really fun, but she alsoshe visited the first time and she visited twice briefly and the first time we were talking andI don't remember what I was saying, but we sort of like talking about the intersection of mental illness in Theology and she was sort of talking about my experience and really got into it and she was like, I'm really sorry like this is your life.I'm like, but it's interesting.Right and she was like he has soThat was good.Only the second time she visited we were sort of Jay the same thing and don't remember exactly what she said but like something was liketouched in her or very much sort of hit me and I'm likewhat sort ofCorvetteand I think that came out either like I said or how it looked I think it's sort of scared her.She reacted really.Well like she sort of just sat with it then like, you know.I told a half way made a joke and those fun I guess like I can't it's hard.It feels sort of hard for me to understand that like people can't see that in me.Like she wouldn't have ever been around me in the contacts.We're likelike she would know that's what it's like.I don't know.It might be things since I can't tell whether they're like it's sort of shorthand that I'm sick.Amusing is Ashley expresses what I needed to express I guess.I mean like I talk to her about like being in the hospital before andMentally ill and having really severe depression trying to describe that.sometimes I'll talk about it and feeling like in the spit orI don't know.And so it doesn't occur to me that people just don't necessarily understand what that means because when I talked about it, I'm just sort of talking about it like this.I don't know.I don't know.You know, I started crying when Mark was there and at the end of the visit he was like, yeah, I've never seen you cry before and you know, he visited me in the hospital before I like, I don't know if that hadn't occurred to me.Yeah.Yes.you know in some ways likeIce Hocking about it because I feel like I feel like that helps me sort of get out of my head around it or something power over it, but it also seems to maybe leave out everything essential.orI don't think so.I think really more out of what was something is there like he was conveying a lot of likes sort of theories about it.And I feel like I mean one of the problems that I ran into with James is that I like him about something thatLike I talk about with you or I talked about with somebody else.He's like, maybe this is what's going on and I will just get stuck on it and then I won't be able to say like no, but they're that sort of simple certain way of talking thinking about it or like things are complicated or that's not the way I'm thinking about it and it's just like wood store to be a little bit more.I don't know.I don'tIs closed anyway?I don't know, but I think I think actually what I'm sort of objecting objecting to I'm not gay don't.Yes.Yeah.Yeah.yeah, but I think that like I'm sort of trying to revise because I think that's like what I'm upset about but it's clearly that if that makes sense likeI think you're right.That's some sort of.Something like I don't know.It's like some part of me that I would not necessarily have chosen to give to people.I'm sorry.I think I interrupted you.Yeah.so if thisoff.I would I want to share it with anybody, but I thinkI don't know.I don't feel like it.I don't think that but I'm worried going forward because I can't tell James things likeI can't Mike figure.I just don't you know that I'm going to be there.I'm like, yeah, it's always there but no I have to pay attention to it.I don't know what I'm going to do.Probably just not think about it or anything.I shouldn't read through all the emails.I think I read the first couple and then I just don't really know that it's necessary or at least right now.I can't deal with it anything else.I think James is really was really angry not like about this, but about my being in the hospital.Yeah.No, I mean I think for me saying is that probably true.I am not sure whether it would have come up if I had a sort of seeing James now like after I came out James was the stress of it.for himYeah.No, yeah, that seems so obvious to me that it only just occurred to me that you were questioning that.Sure.Hi.Yes, we did.So yes, we didn't have.A Morton prompt session on Friday night.Basically what it related to was the fact that I think I mentioned in the past and some of the recordings that I just had a recent surgery and in addition to having shoulder surgery and trying to recover from some very very painful processes.I was having other pain and numbness and tingling shooting down my arm, very concerning things happened.And what ends up happening was I received a in Mir MRI report on Friday that showed I had a herniated disc in my cervical spine in my next to sayTo the say the least it's been taking steroids and doing all of these things.And so I found you on Friday evening because a friend of mine when I was explaining what was going on just sort of giving him the lowdown he proceeded to tell me that I was too young.He says I'm way too young to have a herniated disc.I know he's definitely not.Definitely not.So he said I was too young and then proceeded to tell me about his boss and how his boss had a herniated disc in how he had free steroid injections that surgery is definitely the next up because he plays golf and he's active and he's not following the right plan and how I should definitely go and see his chiropractor and then he's saying a lot of different things that he told me he was going to speak with the chiropractor to see if I can get in there doctor whatever-his-name-is for free because he told me he charged seventy-five and I said I didn't really want to be spending about right now.I'll wait thank you very much.I'll see my doctor on Tuesday.Then he proceeded to call me back and Sheriff.He said would you like the good news first or the bad news?And I said, of course the bad news and he saidWell the bad music it's permanent and you have to wear a brace at a neck brace for two years.My friend the 9 doctor said this so I love myself to get into a state of Hysteria because for whatever reason we don't have to get into it that I guess but I felt very desperate.Oh, I think I turned to listen to people that I think are very smart and I will look at them.Listen and believe what they say and if they say something that sounds like if they're highly intelligent person even when they're not highly intelligent if they say it with conviction.It's like I'm sometimes tend to just feel like it's the word of God.Like if you're saying less than it must be the case.It's this very extreme.It's very exaggerated anexactlyNo, thanks.No, I'm not I make my own decisions.I have my own distraction, but I think that when I'm feeling desperate, I think it's more of that.But I'm never going to be the same again and very many shoulds and must and all those things.I'm very very frustrated at this point because the pain is just the debilitating.I've been feeling it since April and I was sick last year for a.Of 3 months and I just started to feel better from really really ill and I wasn't able to walk and was so down.I felt like I had a good number of months, but it was still teetering on any amount.You know, there was still fear.Of course, I was traumatized by what a matter or I'll say it was it re BP way, I traumatized myself what happened, but regardlessOf that it was still very huge pivotal point in my life and then heard I got better and actually meant like had a girlfriend and everything pretty much 3 months later all of this started to happen.Physical symptoms of my mom arms and stuff like that a few years back before I even got sick.I was in physical therapy for per years because I was able to walk and started having some really bad back stuff.Yeah, like I get this from Shirts by all my issues.I don't want to blame what's happening in my life.In other words all these issues.I was the way I was before if that makes sense.Yes, I've always been someone who's very hard on myself.Oh, really?No fun.So yeah until now yes, this would be wonderful if I could change I mean if anyway.maybe a little bit but I still feel like I'm extremely I feel like I'm still sort of up and down with these sort of things because it takesYes, so then you spoke to me and I have to say thank you for that because it definitely helped in the moment when I was in the store of state of Mass hysteria it definitely I felt calm after our talk and everything.Dizziness, are you were able to show me about it?Wasn't that my friend?You maybe didn't make the best choices and didn't really think of me before he spoke wasn't the truth.Or God that whatever he shared with me was not number one wasn't even accurate.And number two is in the scheme of everything that's going on.It's so nice.You can look at the Ridiculousness of the way.She was speaking to me that he was oh because he did say that at one point educated I said, how do you know all of this about a herniated disc and he said well and educated and I'm like, oh, so I'm not like, I don't know anything.So it's it was funny because thinking back when you made a couple comments like how he's the only the doctor he was going to recommend like he was the only Doctor Who can possibly help me a definition light on the fact that yeah, this is not the only I think I'm very much into putting things into meat little box.Which life is not about does not like that?and there should be one answer and that one person is right in that they have all the answers and I know deep down that that's not it but when I got into certain situations that tend to come up for me where I feel dependent upon what somebody says or doesn't say, it's like talkin seeking the ownership that I make decisions as well even just now the way coming back from work my father's already likeHow are you feeling?Are you going to see the neurologist?He got somewhere back pain and issues and if I ever say to him like Dad, maybe you should try.Not should but maybe look into getting Physical Therapy.He would say I'm fine.I'm fine.I'm fine.That was interesting because he was sharing with me that this is what he thought I should do.You should go call your neurologist you should and then I said, there's no point.I don't need to follow up with him and go back in there the new doctor.I'm seeing on Tuesday.Tomorrow.Yes, I explained that to him and he's like, okay I said, you know how you get when you get frustrated.I'm not really ready to talk right now because that's whenwhen he's in pain Jose, I'm cranky.So basically I shared with him that I just wasn't really feeling up to it and thought I was having a cranky feeling.I guess I was I didn't really think about it like that.okay, so I wasOkay, I guess I was it feels foreign.No, I don't find it easy at all.It's like my hardest thing.O c I thought I was a bitch.That's my go to my go to I have to I end up allowing myself to feel guilty when he's being caring and telling me what he thinks I should do and I don't go with it.No, I was actually on the bus and I'm like, I'm really cranky.Okay.It was just so funny.I'm very lucky.Okay.I did a little bit.But when I went to my friend my close friend who lives in the building, I love him went to her to her Halloween party and there was seeing a lot of friends that I hadn't seen in a while and I think I sort of had to put on a happy face.I didn't have but I chose to put on like a happy face and make it seem like I was feeling I mean this so clearly that I wasn't feeling well, but I didn't have a neck brace on and I felt maybe if I just asked if I'm feeling okay that it will come out that way.I felt like it took a lot of energy and a lot of effort.So when I came home late Saturday, I was there with my girlfriend.I felt like I had he comes I was really getting upset I felt likeStarting to a stop.I don't know what I should say here.But it feels like it's not should but I feel like it's affecting my relationship as well.Just my feeling very depressed.It's hard for me because it's a new relationship.It's hard for me to sort of weed out if it's the relationship or if it's me in the relationship.You can't blame one person for our relationship goes but I feel that the rolls have become almost that I could play.Well, it's me I'm upset and I don't feel well and my girlfriend said in friends comes to like it's going to be okay.And I feel it now starting to trickle into other aspects of my life to the point where I feel like there is a part of me.That's just that feels Jessa.Would you be okay to not even be in a relationship right now because it's still new it's not like a married or in a significant relationship is 25 years is brand new.And so to me it's taking on.I feel like I'm allowing it to see been to a lot of other aspects.My upset in my disturbance over the pain and over my depression, I guess if that's what you want to call it or of just feeling like everyday is hard.No, you're right.Yes.exactlyNo, she's been complaining.She will told me, you know, if I'm ever in a situation you would do the same that I would be there and I would and then of course the end my issue is I thinkbut I don't think I can't think about that right now.I just have to get better myself.I don't want to think about you having an issue.It's like this this to this extent.I just want to think about the fact that you are that you care and love me despite this and that it's not defending that who I am or defending who we are.It's just part of what's going on right now, but that doesn't have to be so humdrum, but then I feel badly because I know she's being put onSo I also know she has a choice in a sense that she doesn't have to stay in the this relationship.So I think that it's a whole mixed bag of things, but I think that a lot of it does come for me feeling that I might be like that regardless.Regardless of whether I had this all this stuff going on right now because in past relationships when I didn't have this I did feel that I had to be bright cheerful happy a peach.Otherwise, it was very extreme.It's like I'm either I can relate back to what I think maybe it comes fromI think it does have to do a lot with the fact that I didn't I felt my mother was very loving towards me when I was in a good mood and when I was down or upset she would push it right away and say you're complaining and I don't want to hear it and when my mom used to say that you're like a doormat and so there's no empathy really beautiful what it would maybe you ask for like 2 or 3 minutes and then I would get that Embassy for 2 or 3 minutes like oh wow, you really do understand and then it was just like you're going to be fine.Like what like quickly let's just move on.I don't have time for this type of thing.That was her attitude when I was good.She was nice and when she disapproves I think I see that in me now, but it's like I have to put on the sort of Sasuke but everything's great because it's the only way I think I'm going to getRewarded.YeahYeah.No, but I really don't I do see that but I feel stuck sometimes like even with all the homework.I did it and I know it's going to take practice and I did the Montrose and everything.I feel like it just takes so much just being completely honest feel like it takes so much effort for me.I don't feel like it comes natural.today 65I did.Yes disappointing but yes.I didn't know there was anything wrong.Okay, that's true.So true.Yes, I do.Okay.Okay.What are y?But I am the follicle.I don't know.Yes.Thank you.So what am I telling myself?Let's see.Well start from morning.You can't do your job effectively.And you are here with an aqueous and everybody is going to think that there's something really wrong with you that you're a mess.They don't.Okay, I'm frustrated with myself.I want answers to what's going on.I think everybody else is fine, and I'm not.I'm lost.I don't know.Because that is really really what I think.Okay.Okay, I should.Okay, I got you.All right, I shouldn't be feeling this way.I should be feeling better.I should be able to go to the gym.I should be happier.I should be braver about the situation that has occurred.All right.I should I not make my girlfriend feel like she's responsible for this.Oh God.This is interesting.Yeah, I guess it is.What are the it is the shirts and the must I must go to work.If I don't I will be looked all look down at myself all what down the kids I'll disappoint.Oh, that would be a tragedy in self.Especially when the kids came to me today and they're like, where were you on Thursday and that I have to be the best at my job.Or I'll just I won't have good feelings about what I do in my job.Nobody will be interested in coming to see me.I won't have a job.Then I don't have any money.I'll be able to afford all of my face things.And then I will be severely depressed and on the street.I don't know.And I passed the bum on the street every day, and I think I'm going to be just like her because she she is.She breathes.She sits by the church.is I really want to just stop for a minute just say that this is really cool, but we just did but I don't thinkAlright.Alright it is it is really interesting.It is really interesting.I am just I think the connections are slow going up there, but I think it is.What are no because I thought that I was under the impression that joke.All the other well, I guess.But this is a she shed.So there you go.It is really cool.If you break it.It's kind of cool.But a word that maybe does that mean?I've been a goody.This is ridiculous.I don't like this.It's a little ridiculous.No, I'm listening to myself.What why have I felt like this?It is not not why beating myself up but it's still interesting.I find it interesting that this can happen that this even become.Because I allowed myself to become that way.Or I didn't know I had another option.I really didn't.I do.So it is The Judds that is what causes depression not all the other stuff.Okay.So what is that?I'm looking around at everyone everybody else.Is that part of it?Because that is what I tend to do islook at everyone else though.They're going to the gym.I'm not show their feeling great.Okay.Yeah, that is well.Did the work to find out what the thoughts were in discover?Oh, that's so it's that disputing now, is that no that is effective.Oh that is looking for the belief, okay.Well, it's the activating events then it's for the police.Yeah.I didn't know what you were looking for.But yeah B.consequenceGot you.That is not it.That's not it.That's not it.Yeah, it's very clear.very clearthe next step to hold it isactivating it is the event then it is the recognizing those beliefs andThe emotion right and then and then disputing.Or is just disputing.Yeah.Yeah, so I said a bun.When was I'm sorry?This is right.Okay.I think I said Mouse.All right.Should I be I just want to say it aloud and then dispute it.So actually be a I shouldn't be feeling this way anymore.This is where this is always whenever Istill no, I've had trouble that it is soBut I haven't.all right, cuzthis goes to this other place when that is eating Tums.Oh, I know just so you can dispute it because it's too hard for you and you should be better at it.Let us know because I'm you know, how you don't always realize exactly what you're thinking when you're thinking it because we're talking about the same time.Maybe if I were sitting in a room meditating by myself, I would know what the thought was.But when I'm talking to you it's not always as quick but now that it is what it is it is that how do you not know?This is what I'm thinking just a how do youNot know already.You've been doing this.This is me.You've always been doing this for five sessions.Debbie has giving you homework.She has told you exactly what to do and you should be able to speak.You should be in a much better spot.This is all new.This is for than territory.I've never done anything like this before.I'm doing everything I'm talking taking a risk by choosing this opportunity to benefit from our EBT in my life because I think there's something for the better for me, but I don't have to necessarily get it or no it right away or even in 12 sessions.It might take 12 sessions to understand it and then maybe 12 weeks to actually apply it.Okay.I relax.I'm not relaxed when I think in that way with the shoulds and the mus.when I think that wayoh my God, I feel completely different.Yes.Yes, absolutely.It is it is.Yes.brightSo is this amazing?Can I ask you though?I wanted to ask you this last week.Actually, do you feel and being so experienced in rebt that you need that person?I don't even want to say it should but that it would be beneficial for the person doing it to be bright intelligent person.Or do you think that just any old Average Joe off the street could apply these techniques?it makesI'm sorry.Okay.Well, the reason I'm asking is because I feel it is.Almost like a light bulb went off after Session 5 because I I see it Bordeaux, but I like to consider myself somebody of high intelligence.I think that it is just interesting.I mean maybe everybody interprets things differently, but I would be curious to know and did I have that thought that somebody who is just I don't even want to say of average intelligence really, but let's just say very basic IQ functioning and this would even make sense to you know, it isOkay.Because I was like to apply it to my students as well.Great.Wow, so how come they don't have this in more education?Okay.Sorry.I am excited.II hate him.No, Iyeah.Yes, there's another step and there's more disputing.So the one I disputed.Yes.Of course.Yeah.Yes.Okay.Okay.All right.Okay.Okay.You're so cute.Yes.Yes, you're just it is just I'm so happy.You were helping me.I am I'm not just saying that I really mean it it definitely is.I feel like a different person from when I came here because I recognize what is going on.Okay.Alright.I know that was good avoidance technique.All right, so, let's see.So I did the one about what I thought I should have thought about where I should have should be up with the rebt at this point, but being better at speed.I just did that one.No, I'd like to dispute the fact that I'm saying I should be I should not be feeling this way and just unfair that I been feeling this way as for as long as I have.as it shouldn't beokay.This one's going to be more challenging.stopOkay, nothing bad is going to happen.All right.Shut up.Okay, okay despite at this time and I'm experienced some health issues.This is obviously a challenge in my life at this point.It is not something I'm jumping up and down excited about at the same time.There is an end in sight because nothing last forever.and it is okay that but I do feel the way that I do right now in the sense thatnot well-liked physically, but I'm not feeling good.Okay, it's not okay.It is the way it is, right?Yes.Well, it's another piece of it because I feel like the medication should be worse and better and that I should have any pain with medication.Okay, the medication will take the edge off but it is not accurate at all.And there are other things that I can do to make sure I have to speak with the doctor and speak with a professional and speak about what the next steps are because medicine is never Patriot Pincus.It's a way of eating to make me feel better.It's not going to cure fix the entire situation.There are other aspects to making this journey a little bit easier and I'll get to that when I speak with someone who knows more about a herniated disc, but I haven't even had that opportunity as of yet.So when I do I'm hopeful that I'm able to have a little more resolution and not just feel uneducated in the terms of what to do next like next steps.No, no.because I'm speaking out what todoing something about it.I'm not justthere's no perfect solution.But I've done some research.I looked a couple things up.I've been hopeful I think that there are probably some nerve and nervousness about going to the doctor tomorrow because it's almost like if I haven't addressed it yet.I haven't heard anything.So it's almost like that no news is good news, but I want to see cancers becauseokay.I should have been on time for you like without just walking in late.Okay, I was actually disputing.The reality is that I was coming from work and that the bus waswell, we walked instantaneously.So if the bus was late.And I said, oh, I don't even do that.All right.Even if I'm late, which I wasn't terribly bad.eventhat was the thought.Okay.No, but then I had another thought that I was terrible for not contacting you to let you know that I was running late.So which one do you want me to spume?Okay, it was more that.First one it was more that one.Okay, so it's soon it is certainly part of my life to be late.Sometimes when you're dependent upon public transit Transportation coming from a job.Okay, I can make mistakes and be running late and it's not the end of the world.And Debbie is not going to come down hard for me on me.IfOkay mites.And if you do it's not the end of the world you'll survive as well.I know one is going to die.Because I was a couple minutes late.Yeah, we hope.Okay.Yeah, I did and then what was the second one that I was?But I should I should have called you to let you know and that not let me just say that the first thought first and not doing that makes me responsible.I will see you always add that last part and that is theOkay.Okay.I mean I meant it before.As we were coming to a close I might.Want to just write down a few of those cuz I have stuff.I forgot once the session ends.I forgot that piece that last piece of it.The last piece is I think the country because you have other thoughts, but then at the end of the thought is that which I shouldn't be which I must do which is the conscious thought like it is it is one that ties up ties it up on me.Yes.Okay.Let me see.I should have called you.And not doing that makes me responsible thoughtless person.As I should have be I should be more responsible.I should be more thoughtful.Okay.This one is tough.I need help.Okay.Okay Debbie.Are you aware right now?But that is quite okay, but you didn't reach out in that.I mean, it would be nice if you were able to make a phone call, but if you were in the middle of transportation and couldn't get to doing it, I'm sure that Debbie I'm talking if I'm talking to you.I wouldit would be under that you would be under understand.That would be very understanding.No, it is.I can't I mean I can which is funny.No, cuz you're human and humans.Don't do everything exactly how they shed.You're being very hard on yourself.Yes.I think you're torturing yourself.I know.Yes.Yes.Why can I ask a question about this whole thing?Why does it feel this is the part I'm confused about.Why does it feel Ashley uncomfortable to dispute?Probably because I've never done this before so it's new.I know it is.It's exhausting.I'm exhausted.I'm so exhausted right now.I'm like, oh my God.I'm in a better mood, but I'm exhausted if that makes sense.No, I don't think so.No.Yeah.don'tI amyes.Okay.No, I just forgot which one we were disputing.Oh about the phone call and that I should have called andbrightbut in thinking about this Debbie isI don't know on this one.I really don't because I think that it's probably for me.This is where I challenge myself in the most making sure that I appear that I do everything responsibly and so it is most almost like pulling off a veneer.and that is why I don't really want to do this one because it feels like oh Debbie Ashley did know that I was struggling to get across town and that I wasn't going to call but it almost feels like a cover like I'm going to wedding this but that is that I'm not perfect and IYes.This is why I'm having a hard time right this one.Yes.So I apologize for not being able to come up with the perfect answer for her right now, but that is obviously how I torture myself throughout the day.So and also I really don't know what to say.I don't know how to dispute that one.And I don't know why I don't know how to dispute it.The last one about the phone call.I feel like the doctor was easy.That was easier to dispute the one about me feeling like I shouldn't be feeling this was easier.But one with the phone call really hurt hurt.It is really hard.But I don't even have an answer.The irrational belief is that you're not going to like me anymore if I don't get here on time and that you're going to not want me to come back and that you're going to be finished with this because you thought I was being irresponsible, but I wasn't here as I should be worse possible because I arranged you the session with you.No, I'm not aware of that now.I guess I am because you just pointed out.But I was not aware of that.How can I I can'tcooking gasOkay.Or maybe you just borrow the pain.I want to just write a few things done to remind myself.Okay, thank you.I could do both.Okay.Okay.Okay.Imperfectly, yeah.Effective New Philosophy, let's do the doctor one or the going to the doctor and should be feeling better.We do that.Okay, there may be no perfect solution for what I'm experiencing.Trumpgret there may be no perfect solution.I will continue to investigate and check out different options in order to feel better.Physically may not be one perfect answer.And I can stand it.I'm not going to fall apart or play with me orunless I allow myself toremind myself that I am fallible human that does make mistakes, but doesn't do everything exactly like an ingredient that you put together and come up with something perfect model person.and that all still be loved and if I'm not loved then that it is I have to love myself so thatI can I can I can still accept myself despite not being a perfect human.There's no such thing.There is no such thing.It is really scary to do this kind of stuff though.I can't believe I've been like this for 35 years and never knew.And I didn't and I didn't recognize what have you been doing.Just a you went to Farabee you you went to school for this.You should know more.Yes.Yes.Okay.Dispute the whole weekend with my parents.That is true.trueYes, I did.Yeah, I did.I did.I definitely felt progress.I think that it clearly it was easy to do other stuff and has been up until now about other stuff the beliefs that I had the A's at all.and then when it came to theDisputing part it's a little harder, but it definitely got easier as I did more because I did a bunch.So yeah.it justwe are creatures of habit.And so this is the new Hobbit.so yes, when we let ourselves to be so this isa new these are new habitual things that INew behaviors that I need to or not need to know no.Baby helpful for me in order to be happier and not to feel this enormous amount of pressure that I never realized I did until now which is astonishing to tell you the truth.I can't lie about it and I think like anything I guess.With overtime you build a different mantra.Yeah.rightIt was a short time in the good news.I know we have to come to an end.Now in the session with a good news was that I did actually speak to him the next day and he was angry at me because I did actually read reach out to tell him that I was going to the doctor and I used your tactic to tell him that I wasn't going right away.It was an hour and a half before I was still just really over what had happened to did really feel like calling him and I did actually he reached out to me and I said I want to let you know that as much as you might see you knew about the new a lot about a herniated disc.Thank you for sharing.I did do some research myself and as much as he thought x y and zWasn't exactly what you said.So next time baby just be a little more cautious before you start sharing information with people that you think might be in their best interest but really isn't what is the reality?And I was pretty assertive with him which is new for me.So I guess if I want to focus on what I did, yeah.So yeah, it's all good actually.Yes.nowmy friend.Oh, yeah.You didn't call him the drama queen friend, so I didn't know who you were talking about.The drama queen friend, okay.rightThank you, Debbie.very helpfulI think what actually would be helpful instead of focusing on the shud the musk and writing that down.I think talking about it how you did with the next step like going that next level because I think it's important for me to really get the concept that it's not just I should be like it's not so simple as I should be a good student it is if I'm not like in other words all the worst possible putting it all out there in terms of what I really think not just going by the books and looking at Homework ofexactlyreally investigating it instead of just like giving you a performance.So this is what I should say to Demi when she comes really you doing my own.Well, meaning that I in other words if you give me homework, you know, my thought already It is Well, you don't because you're not a psychic but you kind of get the theme of how I think which is that I should do my homework in so if I'm doing it, I'm doing it to give to you like I did my work or I'm doing it because I'm really investigated where the sort of the thought sort of goes astray thatIt is so I think the best for me right now would be to investigate to see to really stop and think and go through it instead of just anyone can write down a bunch of I should have be perfect.I should be that is so easy that that is notIt is easier than dispute India.Yes.Oh, yeah, and then that is speeding of course.Okay.All right.more of D&DOkay.rightOkay, sounds good.Okay.greaterYeah.It makes perfect sense know I'm kidding.Just so that I'm making sure that I'm understanding this really, what is this sound too and the gist of rebt is that we do make ourselves depressed.There is the biochemical.Yeah, that was my essential question you.You kind of see.That makes sense.I see.Yes.It was my son.It is it is the way I talk to myself.It is just hard to know what comes first, but I think if we start withOkay, fine.I got it.definitely better more empowered and more ready to sort of attack a lot of these thoughts andattack the irrational beliefs the appnot as much as much.cuz I'm recognizing what is actually creating these disturbing emotions and situations thatRight, right.Yes, I do.Thank you.I did.It was pretty easy.I'm very familiar with these descriptions.Soyes, but I would say I look at Ivan in same that's a little black and white.Or that's a little like I can.But it's hard for me.I guess to do it as much with myself and even if I do even if I am aware that that's a bit.It's so hard to pull back because some of the emotions that go with that.Right, and it's hard to be objective when you're looking at yourself.I'm thinking is this all-or-nothing thinking or is this a little more realistic than I want to admit?so it's hard sometimes soI think emotional reasoning is one that I felt a little stumped on I guess I feel like I do it but I'm not quite sure what a good example would be.I mean I gave one but I don't know if it's as good as it.That sometimes I'm worried that things in my marriage might not improve enough or what if they don't are all of the what ifs and then what am I going to do?If it doesn't what am I going to?And I wonder if that isn't based on how it feels more than based on the progress that's been.like the timeline or facts or theSo it feels a little less concrete of an example.I think it's fear mostly.anxietywhat if anxiety?Is that but there's also the things might be changing somewhat, but it's not fast enough.It's not this enough.It's not enough.It doesn't meet up where my expectations it doesn't meet up where I thought things would be so what if it doesn't continue to progress or what if it doesn't Progressive at a rapid and that's what I said and snowballs a bit.But then I would go through the steps to try to rationalize it.I would think actually that's a lot of progress in a short.Of time.Or actually this this unless they're really good steps that have made a big difference.But then I sometimes have a little bit before giving but I think to myself I've put up with you know, a lot of this type of thing for a really long time.No wonder I'm you know, kind of really impatient and ready to move on be done with it.So I sometimes think thatyeah.I also worried that I guess I could change my expectations and lower them.Because I feel like this is terribly critical but I think to myself like not pushing him to apply to other jobs.I'm even going to be content with him being a manager at Subway because he's struggling with it still at time.And I wonder if you know where would be the answer for him.Actually, that could be the worst.Even if it looks like a great job or more money or more.Whatever.So I find myself thinking that that and I kind of don't like myself for it.Because I'm thinking oh, wait a minute.This is not at all.What we thought would be the case.Don't worry about that, too.Yeah.The thing that happens with that type of hypothetical scenarios is a small part of me looks at Ivan and says, what would that be like what happened?Or why is that you know?Again, there's nothing wrong with being a manager at Subway.But if you have the potential to do something and you studied a specific field andWhat happens with that what happened?So there's a small part of me that thinks that that but there's a bigger part of me that thinks what is wrong with me?That would be the type of snobby whatever person that being married to someone who's the manager at Subway wouldn't be enough or would it be fulfilling his potential or would it be?Like what does that say about me?Well, yes, and I guess I want to be so critical of myself and that because that's just not I would never look down at anyone who works there.But then if it's my husband who is working as a manager at Subway and I think about him doing that for 20 years.I think that's not I don't know.It's not exactly what I would have thought would be fulfilling his potential.Or what?I thought you know you think his college education would look like or I guess not the type of West lifestyle.I thoughtmaybe even money-wise not.And he's not really passionate about working at a sandwich shop.So I would feel like it would just be a job which some people have, you know, just a job and that's not their big thing in life.That's okay, but I don't know if that's what I I don't know if it's okay with me.I don't feel good about that.I feel like that makes me this horrible snobby demanding critical.Because I guess when I feel like when you marry someone it shouldn't be I'm marrying you because I know you are a lawyer or a doctor.Are you not like and you will always are in a good living and have a you know, fulfilling career that will last you until retirement.Do you feel satisfied with the errands good money.That is secure they're passionate aboutI'm not sure.That's the right reason to marry someone it certainly didn't factor into why married Ivan, but now that we're married I feel guilty about wanting those things.Maybe it can matter some but I feel like I guess I feel like that says something pretty bad about me if that's not okay.Yeah, I know.It really sounds like I'm stuck up.Like being a manager at Subway, you know, it's an honest job.It's a good job.But why would that not be good enough?I think there's a part of that if it wasn't Ivan's one dream to manage a sandwich shop, and he wanted to say that he wanted to stay with this and work his way up or just keep doing it.The back could feel a lot better A lot different.And if we came to the realistic understand that that was his passion and that's what he was going to do, but he wasn't going to pay the bills you were going to compensate through me for him doing another job like some way.I feel like that would be more and more realistic scenario.That's not the case and what if the reality is this type of job is you know, totally unrelated to what he went to school for what if that's the best bit for him now for a while.It's scary for me and I feel bad about that.I feel responsible that he doesn't feel proud of it.But he's like afraid to feel proud of it.Yeah.Yeah.Yep.That's the weird thing because I hated never seeing my dad.I got to the point where I didn't want to see my dad because I was so angry at him that I was never going to come first.And yet it was easier in a way because I could be proud of his, you know, great education of an incredible work ethic the fact that he owned and ran his own business completely by himself.The fact that he was coming home, you know at an ungodly hour, but he just delivered a you know, knew something rather.He just saved some animals life is just did some crazy for our surgery.That feels it doesn't feel good.Don't give me wrong.It doesn't feel good.But it feels very different.From like the polar opposite like Russ ambition miseducation us drive less work ethic.Not passionate about it.rightrightAnd he compared to most of my friends parents.Nobody's parents worked longer hours.Nobody had more education that my dad nobody.I felt proud of that.I do think that's okay.I think that's a healthy thing to feel proud about I guess the other part that made it feel okay was the thought of my mind that he could have it that he could if he had had, you know, Partners or whatever if he had joined a practice he could have had normal hours and made a good living.And still have been the success so it wasn't like that.There was more potential for it.Yeah, it does.It does and I guess the other maybe it's most important to me now at this point in my life, but my dad is like she's not always there and conversations with him are usually very short and he's driving on his way to a call.But he's incredibly supportive.It was incredibly supportive when I was going to school if I wanted to do another program tomorrow.She would be ridiculously support a puppet.Not financially or anything, but he would just always want to ask about it the encouraging.End up looking for jobs.He's very supportive.I guess he's always wanting to talk about and be involved with jobs and academics and that's important at this point in my life.And Ivan is not up to talking about this topics right now.And I guess it's also more of it's a bigger thing because those are topics that I associate with adulthood or being you know mature and responsible.Having it together having a career and a plan for your life being motivated and ambitious.But I do also wonder if Ivan continues to make progress with his depression with his attention disorder if he continues to like he sort of gets to a baseline with his job where he gets to the point where he's doing it well and things are going smoothly consistently and he feels like he could potentially maybe you could reach that to maybeYeah.No, yes, it it sounds accurate actually to what I'm feeling and one of the biggest things that I that doesn't feel fair to criticize but in finding that our expectations my expectations when she said we're totally on board like he was on board with them.They were correct.You led me to believe this was all how is going to be.Right well to some extent.I mean he clearly he said he left grad school because it wasn't for him and I had a really tough time with that.But that was something I was going to be able to accept what actually happened not so much but the bear problem with it is I feel like I haven't has no clue what he wants out of life right now.I feel like if I told him tomorrow we should buy a house you'd be like, yeah, let's work up towards that.If I said we should start a family tomorrow, he would probably that might be a little extreme.But the point is I feel like he's been wishy-washy one random job to the next.And just you know going with whatever is given to him just not proactive not engaged not motivated or ambitious.What does he what does he really want?How do I know that he really wants to be married to me if he doesn't know any like an idea of a type of career?Or did you ever want to go back to school?Does he ever want to you know own a house and things like that?I guess I feel like he has no clue and that's not something that is so acceptable to me.And that's another where it's easier with.My dad.My dad has never had a different career.Like you've never been unemployed since you was email a teenager before then.I mean she just never discussed.Yeah, that's hard to take in a guilty part of me inside things Ivan's almost old enough.What if he was about to be a doctor?What if he was about to be a lawyer or a baby?Awesome?like to be married to someone who wasI don't know energetic and had a great career that they were passionate about and did a lot with.rightYeah completely in Emma.But again, she does something that she's very passionate about and works incredibly hard and has been ambitious and getting more degrees and going above and beyond her 40 hours a week.And it's just hard for me to look at Ivan and be this is horrible but to be satisfied.With the way that so the only way I'm coping with it is stinking suggest for now.Is trying to get on his feet.It's not the end of the world.This is actually the best job.He's ever had in his life so far like the most responsibilities the most skills to be developed.by farRight.Yeah, he's never had to manage people.He's never had to be accountable for meeting timeline throughout the day and managing his time.Yeah, it does not feel good.Especially for someone like me who feels like they need to be in control.rightI feel like I have to have a pretty clear plan.I'm upset with myself right now because I don't know what my next step is.So it's like really it's not feeling very tolerable.Well, I saw you not that long ago.But I guess things it feels pretty intense sometimes.The depression I will say I've noticed a couple of times where it's been a great day.I spent time with Emma or Ivan or both.Just that type of day and I'm still finding myself feeling down on myself feeling like a little down feeling like there's no explanation for it in the moment.Look at the moments where I feel like there is underlying depression and it's not always.Directly a result of something that happens.Yeah.rightI think that's more the self-hate than the depression.Although I'm sure that's connected, but I can feel a little low sometimes.It's pretty much like things are going well and make a mistake or I say something that I think back on and I wish I would have said that differently or I wish I would have done that differently.I wish Iyeah, that could be it.Or simple as I wish I hadn't kept my sister waiting or I wish I was more decisive about that and it's I hate myself and then it can stay low for a little while.And then like I'll move past it but it's a very I don't know why but those are three words that come into my mind when something like that happens.Let's become a coping thing for me.I know that's unhealthy, and I want to work on that.Yeah, it's embarrassing.So my parents gave me a gift certificate for clothing at two different stores for my birthday.Because I needed some clothing and so those stores are having sales.So I went with Emma.She needed some stuff too, and I kept her waiting.I was taking longer like she was ready to go sooner than I was.rightrightI'm still trying to make decisions and I find myself like catching myself and like it doesn't have to be perfect Corona.Just because you know, you don't usually go shopping or you've been given this great gift that you feel really guilty about does it mean that you have to Analyse which sale is the best to an extent Beyond normal.It doesn't mean you have to obsess over spending it perfectly most wisely, whatever.And you're keeping your sister waiting.She works like crazy all week.And you don't and this is how she spending our weekend.You need to be more considerate.Feeling self-conscious because I felt like in that time she's taking care of me like she always has.She doesn't know how to stop doing that.I don't know how to.I just I feel like I need to step up more so that she doesn't feel like she has to sometimes.I'm thinking oh I should have just come by myself.I feel so bad that Ior just come back another time.I'm taking too much time.I was just thinking I hate myself like this is unacceptable.How can I be doing this to her?And in reality, she's just like it's fine.If I would have tried on that I would have taken a longer toit doesn't I think I have normalized it.Not to be but it doesn't.Have a huge impact on me.It feels necessary for me to feel bad about it.Just like when I got the gift card at felt necessary, I felt absolutely necessary for me to feel bad.I always do.I don't know completely why I always do.I think it's really it's the money exclamations with money.Being spent on me.Yeah.I know it is but I think that's them if someone doesn't feel very good about themselves.They don't really feel good about.You know.I wish I could give it back like I wish I could.But even so I've mentioned and it's a very brief way to describe it.But Emma has taken care of me since I was littlein so many ways and she still does it.In different ways so she comes over because we will plan to do dinner sometimes so she'll come over especially if I've been still at work.And will cook something until sometimes bring over.So just show up with this ingredient with ingredients for a new recipe and she'll say oh I just stop by the store.Let's make this new pasta salad.And it's taking care of me in a way or even if I do the cooking but she still comes over and talks with me about my day and she still follows up.Like how did your interview go?And she's always still taking care of me and she's always been very reluctant to share if you even a small thing in her day went wrong.She's very much the mom.She's buried.Yep, because she's always she's like, but then you will get upset.I don't want to wear you about it.I don't want that to be on your mind.I don't want you to feel like you can't talk to me about something that's going wrong because you're worried about me.Like just really to an extreme.She's been my mom.She's 29.I mean like and I tried to tell her even though I think and she's you know, she still feels that way.I think especially because of the role Ivan is played this far.I wish you didn't feel like she had to take care of me and I don't know I always feel bad.So even if she comes over after a long day of work and we make dinner or even if I make her dinner, I still feel a little bad becauseYeah very much.So I mean not only is she taking care of me now, but when things with Mom and Dad were explosive.She was there to talk it out and make sure I was okay, but even to the extent of Ramona did you do this?Do you want to take care of this?How is it going just really mothering.Really mothering in a very loving way in a very caring way not in a controlling way.But I feel really bad about that.It must be exhausting for her.Yeah, and I feel bad because she's not telling me about her bad days.Emma is not a complainer, but she's not like nothing and that doesn't feel like a two-way street because it's not so much all the time.She's really mostly and she'll say sometimes you don't realize your Moana but when I come over and we do dinner or whatever that helps even if I don't talk about how bad my day was it helps me do stress and it helped me get away for a little bit.So I don't know but I always wonder if there's a part of me that is it still feeling like I need or wanting that motherly care.Like I didn't get enough as a poor way to put it but I stillWant it or need it?And now I'm actually at an age where it's like get over it because it's no longer appropriate.It's no longer.I should no longer need it for the most part.No, no.No.She does not know.sono, I didn't mean to interrupt that something doctor Pharaoh just came up with she said that we should work with our individual therapist and come up with something that the others could do.Every day, she said I think it should be everyday.She gave the example of she said every couple does this there's something they need from the other one and it's not the you do the dishes.I do the laundry.she said it's likeyeah, so she says it could be I need you to meet me everyday at 5 after work at home.And have a glass of wine and talk about my day and ask about it.She said that that could be one Partners request and that that's so she said we should work with and try to come up with something like that.Do I have?Okay.I thought about I told her I thought it was hard because sometimes the Baseline like that you do the laundry.I do the dishes doesn't get mad.And I'm like, why would I add something else to the list when we're not you know that she said just to give it a try.So I thought about the you know, so I mean 30 minutes a day that he could justtalk with me about my day.I would feel good.That's the thing.I think it's more about his absent-mindedness.But everyday whenever he gets home from work, I'll ask him about work.We don't always have a big discussion, but it's always like how was work.How did it go?It doesn't always immediately reciprocate with that.I think part of it is just the way his family is everybody jumps and then there's not much asking it's like everybody just says so nobody takes the time to ask and part of it is just I think he forgets and it gets a littleBut it feels great when he does it.So that was the thought.Actually, I'm sorry if I could completely not that that's not important.But if I could completely switch gears for the last 5 minutes.I am I should have done this earlier, but I guess I feel like I need something.I don't know.This job search is getting depressing.I'm feeling depressed and down on myself.I need I think an emotional boost or some kind of boost because I'm getting to the point where I'm like, why am I even going to look on this job where there isn't going to be anything?And a lot of them there hasn't been anything lately.That would be appropriate or me to apply for.You got a genuine thing that feeling like oh, there won't be anything.Even if there is I have to do the application.If I do that, I won't get an interview.I got an interview I won't get the job offer.It's just I don't know that I know that I'm doing that to myself and the other night.I had this freak out.I thought I'm not going to get a job and it's going to be my fault because I stopped doing applications.You can't get a job remote if you don't apply and so I need a way to keep going.it is and it's also feeling frustrating to spend like a couple of hours and all I can say is I looked through the job boards for this this and thisand there was nothing and that time is gone and I still don't have a jobYeah, it's feeling daunting and exhausting.And I feel like it's tomorrow's two weeks since that interview for that really good job, and I haven't heard anything about a second interview.I'm starting to feel like I got all these interviews and I was great but now the interviews has have stopped.My applications have stopped a lot and I have no offers.Yeah.Yeah.What do you mean?oh that youYeah, clearly, I need to be working.Of course, where's the money going to come from one positive thing?I did which I'm hoping will help is I joined Career Services set up this job Seekers Workshop.And it's literally for new graduates.Pasadena Career Servicesmeeting once a week and doing a check in and talk about strategies and things like that.But I feel like I need to push myself to go to networking events and to do more.Like getting more resumes out there, even though I feel self-conscious.Because not only just in an application but just professors.I know that may or may not have research for me like no opportunities just reaching out to them and letting them know I'm looking things like that.rightI am becauseIt's like after spending hours on the computer.It's like I just can't be on the computer anymore.I haveso every Monday I go spend five hours to volunteer on that study.And now yeah, I do.The thing is is other people get paid to do exactly what I'm doing.But by the time I joined the study, I feel like she's out of grant money.So I'm not getting $15 an hour.I'm getting nothing, but it's just frustrating but it's good for my resume.And now Friday I start orientation for a patient.Advocacy at Walter Reed.Which is something I'm interested in.I'm interested in patient navigation, which is pretty related, but that's also volunteer.I've been told by one of my professors that you got to be at least volunteering you'll go crazy if you just do nothing but apply to jobs, so I'm hoping like it can't hurt.It is.And hopefully I'll make some connections.Yeah, it's nothing else is adding and it's giving me something to get out of the apartment and feel productive.Okay.Thank you.Okay.Do you want should I?Okay.Thank you.Yeah, I think so.Yeah.I'm not doing so well continuing to not do well pretty crappy to I don't I'm supposed to go to dinner after this.I guess I'll see how it goes.All the time that I had for the blacked out this weekend for for caring for tutoring and also preparing researching for this talk during the week pretty much most of it but like staring blankly at it.So I've been doing a lot of that.I feel like I have some creep disease but like it doesn't look like it and that's something like every 5 or 10 minutes after I started decide not to kill myself that takes a lot of work.I become mad andI feel like I'm less concerned about how other people are going to feel about the things that say than I usually am which in itself is probably a good thing, but nobody seems to mind.Yeah.Yeah.You mean abandoned abandoned, right?Okay, that's what I thought.Yeah, it's not yeah.I don't know.I'mI'm afraid of dying, but I think I'm more afraid of just continuing to be like this.You know just started frantically racing through my options.And if I do this, then this will happen and if I do this, then this will happen then these are the things that might happen visible things that probably won't happen.Like I just can't I can't come up with one where that doesn't keep.You know that the best I can come up with is things get better for a while, which at this point is not so bad.I have lots ofI feel likeI feel like the.Where I start thinking maybe this will just be over like maybe I won't have to feel this way and then it comes back.I feel like that is really bad that it's the worst and soYeah.Somehow it still seems very important because we have to learn now that this is what my wife is occurring now.I feel like the little things that might.Yeah.I don't care.It's really bad.I mean it gets worse than this but notthat much worse.Yeah, even like the fault isn't as much a thing anymore.Like I don't end up hurting myself.yeah, I don't know IHaven't been thinking about hating myself as much and sometimes it's blank.It's still there somewhere, but I don't have to deal with it all the time.It took me to the whole day to sort of tell myself.Like, you know, Tanya really have to tell somebody at church at church about this like this is your job.Tell them to do their job.And so I like at the end of the was I was leaving told one of the priests that I'm doing really badly and ask her to pray for me and she said she would she said like you're awesome at the end that sort of ended me not like you're awesome.So you shouldn't be feeling bad but more like you should remember that.You're awesome.Yes, I sort of a little bit.I'm a sick man.It's like the tissue box that will not die.Yeah.Yeah, and my thought was that's completely the size of me, but it's just weird thing.Like I know why she would think that I'm awesome.Like I can see how I look to other people, you know, at least two other people who think I'm awesome.I can see that but like it doesn't matter.I guess so.I mean if you poke at it like I'm miserable because I feel like I'm a terrible person and part of it comes around butYeah.Yeah.Anyway, when I like my when I like involve myself or fend for myself is at least a presumption that things could be different, but I don't feel like that's a possibility.It's like the only computer game.I remember ever playing we never had a computer games when I was little we just didn't have any consoles and never got any other.So it was like a brief.Of time where golden I was like the game.It was a long time ago, but there was a time and so like a little bit after it came out.I was over like a like a family friend's house and they're a little like kids downstairs playing a game.And so I picked it up and play it and just like could not like I couldn't get the character who walked around out of the corner.Like I was just in a corner the entire game, but it was like wellWas it for video games like not much fun when you can't get out of the corner.So that's what I feel like.Yeah, and in that game everything's dark the entire time.I'm likeIt feels like you and James and doctor is like people who are trying to help me.It feels like with the best of intentions You're All I've been afraid to continue down this incredibly painful and destructive path.That's disorienting.I know.Yeah.butI hear you.Am I surprised?Not really.Yeah, I do.I don't feel good about that.Yeah.I don't really like the alternative either.Yeah.Yeah.mostlythings like the highest likelihood of success combined with what it's most likely I'd actually do.Yeah, what districts are hard but not that hard to hard if I want them to be hard.This tutoring sessions going to be more.I thought about just taking the car somewhere.I think maybe I just won't go to tutoring.2:30he's at home.Yeah.I don't know.It doesn't matter.Yeah, I wasn't so sure of making it through the weekend.Part of me dies because it's hard to have to keep the fight and not kill myself.Part of me.Most of me doesn't because it's a pain in the ass and it doesn't seem like I feel like I got to the same place that I started out in.I forgot the option.But I continue to think that it would be worse to try and fail than not to try and fail if that.Yeah, I don't want to think about it.Yeah, yeah, if it were like two hours later, that's so long then.It's like 3 hours.yeah 3but they be either or like 3 hours.I would feel like there was ayeah, sometimes I can rally.But I think maybe I need to not ask myself to Rally right now.I hadn't thought about that.Yeah.I don't know, you know, I can't decide whether it be better to go to work tomorrow or not to go to work tomorrow.Seems like a long way off though.I don't know.I could take a nap right now.Sorry.I'm just likeI don't even want to say it like okay Chad, so I'll tackle the afternoon.I'm sorry.That's not quite it but I don't know how to I don't know how I can explain it.I had a I don't know what it's like it doesn't feel like you're trying to put pressure on me or like it doesn't feel like you're asking this of me.It's more like I don't know who it is.I don't know.Yeah.Right now like you have a dial on your back just the pressure that I'm not actively to kill myself this afternoon.Yeah, I know I can make it through the next few hours, but I don't know if I want to will know.I know I don't want to I don't know whether I'm willing to.probablyyeah.Yeah, I'm counting on it.No, that's okay.Yeah, that's how it goes.I feel better for a while and then I feel worse for a while.Okay.Yeah.He knows what's going on.He we talked about it this morning and he acted sort of trying to keep it in scaring him too much for would have doubted on him too much.So we talked about it this morning, but on the way home, he asked me whether you and I had talked about hospitalization or something.Yeah, I think he knows Destin option now.I know.Yeah.Okay, I'll be I could probably go home to stare at the wall.So, you know, I can do that here.No, I don't know.I feel like it's equally impossible.I equally possible that, you know, I could go home and watch some TV and joke around with James and have a nice night and then I could go home and said that I'm done.I can't tell and yeah clearly I usually end up the former butYeah, I usually ended always.Yeah, well know sometimes I'm miserable and don't go.Yeah.Okay.Yeah, I mean, I know that's not what you mean.Yeah.No, I mean if it starts to feel absurd to be there, then I'll come home.I guess my question is will they just let me leave?Okay.Thanks.No, I can just call.Sorry, I assumed that was your lunch.Hey, hey, it's Tanya.Hey, are you there James?Yeah, okay.Sorry.I'm still at therapy.Chad wants me to go to ER.So can you come over?Okay.Thanks.Thanks.Probably 10 minutes.I don't know.I would think you would want to talk to you briefly.So what do I do now?Okay.No, thanks.Yeah.I don't how but I have to get in touch with the person.I'm supposed to be tutoring.It's like one of those websites so I don't.No, I don't I do somewhere, but it's not like my phone.I could actually okay.Yeah.So it's snowing.It's snowing.Yeah, it's mostly been a bit cold and windy.So yeah.I still have been feeling not really not feeling great.I don't know.She's like getting its kind of I was at a Sci-Fi convention a big Buckle sci-fi convention this weekend.Did they explain my anxiety anxiety about how I had to stay with friends andYeah, I ended up going and so the conventions at the hotel Westin Convention Center of like a big Weston and something like 3,000 people last time I went it was more like 2,000 dish in the plaza.It was really intensely noisy and aggravating in that like there were lots of people in various costumes, which is usually very fun.Like I like that but I was getting frustrated at people with big costumes or big costume Parts like walking in into the aisle or whacking into you said a lot of people were excited to see each other and shrieking all weekend.And then there was the drunk talking too loud in the elevators and just it was like over-stimulating isn't exactly describing it.It's like wow.Is there a lot of really kind of mildly annoying things usually really ramped up and in one space?Yes, like way and I wasn't really usually I'll start out at convention and be like all guys you're all over the top.But that's okay teenage girls and salad costumes.That's great.Dalek costumes from Doctor Who Daleks are these evil robots?It used to be that they could only move forward and backward on a flat tread stairs defeated them.And then in the new reboot, someone was like haha.We'll go up the stairs and then they levitated one of the things that these cute little teenage girls.They were wearing like cute little prom dance dresses that look like the Dalek robots and I was like, oh that's cute, you know people do a lot of reinterpretations, which is usually fun, but I sort of never had that, LOL everyone's really jammed in and kind of crazy and annoying, but I still love you moment.I just sort of was oh my God, I hate everyone.I mean also I had a complete break out before packing because I couldn't find a bottle of painkillers had a bottle of Vicodin and I couldn't find it anywhere.So I got super stressed about it like tearing apart my apartment.my hipyeah, it's not constant.It's just that it's kind of like well, you know, it's comforting to have the concept of it more than anything and also like walking around a lot blah blah blah.I don't know if I really could sayfor a whileThen I was like, oh shit.I have to leave right now.So that was just a little bit much but it was weird.I didn't exactly I wouldn't say I had a good time.I want to say I had a bad time.It was mostly just a lot is how I felt about it.And this word is there's a significant downside of like I'm acquainted or passingly familiar or friends with a ton of people there and there's like I'm sitting there talking to someone is always a string of people that are like hey, how are you blah blah blah, and it was just like hello, but I'd really like you to go away right now or just like it was hard to just sort of hang out and talk to a few people quietly.Other than like my hotel room even in like I had dinner with some friends in a restaurant Pub attached and of course a whole bunch of people ended up walking by our booth to go to their table and I don't know I guess I kind of missed everything is always been kind of it's big and kind of overwhelming and kind of noisy, but I really miss not having any sort of not really having an issue over everyone Hi or hanging out in a group of more than four people.So that was frustrating the thing I had forgotten or made myself forget is a reason yes panel are really disorganized and half-assed and it drives me crazy people the panelists always talk here to their friends in the front or they'll be like, I'm not prepared.I don't know why I'm here.I just like so even though I knew that I talked out of two panels within 10 minutes.I just was too frustrating.So there was that.I don't know I didn't buy books because the dealers room was too big.I justthe dealers room was really big.It's like a I don't know what else to call it, you know like a big Convention Center space.Yeah, you know usually there's like there's some books out there and t-shirts and sort of sci-fi.Jokes through a lot of them a lot kind of like it was I just felt like I can't figure out what I want to this really loud anti Sunday Kind of steak smelling crowd.Like I don't know.I was just kind of having the everything that ever irritates me about the sci-fi fantasy fan and knocked me all weekend.interinterspersed interspersed with hanging out with people I like and talking to them and then being really annoyed at people.Yeah, it was.Not really, although the last time I seriously attended a reason yet, which is a convention.I was really frustrated by like I'm signed up to do a lot of paneling about race and science fiction and kind of wanted to murder half the audience and had someone basically heckled me over a t-shirt that I have that said black nerds Unite.yeah, andyassoYeah, because I was just like I did this panel.I'm like, oh, I hate everyone basically and then I laughed and hung out with friends and then and it was so more like parts were definitely fun.And I did like they're usually a dozen parties happening or so and I didn't go to any of them this year.I was just so a I can't drink anything but I just was sort of like I think without a little a drink or something to make this go smooth.I'm like, I need some form of social lubrication here and being around of lot of a lot of really drunk people while sober is boring.yeah, I mean being with them in the elevators was bad enough, I guess part of what II mean part of it was all so yeah, I mean I mentioned before that like guys yelling always makes me nervous so I can mention Hall guys yelling is perhaps not ideal.So it was sort of this mix of feelings.Like is this the medication I might just irritated and like for me the biggest frustration and I was talking to dr.Bond about it and she was like, well, I went up to I guess the clinical I guess you meant she wanted me to wanted me to take of this Alexa was a week ago.So she's like, well, you know, maybe it's more time which I agree with the erratically.I'm just really not enjoying it.And I think the other thing is I'm always worried about expressing anger watt.So even though I'm pretty sure that I didn't come off as particularly ruffled or whatever.I just sort of I just been worried about it and feeling like is this going to be is it going to get more annoying less annoying?Should I just stop going to conventions this big because it's a lot bigger than I usually go to do in this whole like I don't know I guess part of it was that I don't feel like I know if I was feeling more irritated just from the jump because I've been feeling more depressed or if I'm feeling more irritated because of medication or if I was feeling more irritated because I'm obsessed with her concerned about feeling more irritated.Yeah part of this thing where I'm sort of like waffle waffle on is sci-fi conventions, very a lot and are easy as definitely I don't know how to say it.It's kind of Rowdy a little bit Rowdy.It's a little bit drunk It's kind of focused on sex a little bit which comes under the long boring 25 your argument with another sci-fi convention in the area.SoYeah, the hotel that it's in while there's a lot of a lot of space which is good.The main lobby area is like it was designed for business conventions.Not a ton of people being really social and running around screaming.So, you know, like there's that set up which is kind of like it's really hard to describe.It definitely cemented in my mind that I don't think I like at least right now.I'm not liking that genre of convention like which is I love the costuming that people do but about half the other things I was just like no, I just like having programming running like all through the night.So they're doing gaming and movies.Basically, something is happening 24 hours and there's no like dinner breaks or anything or any breaks built-in.So everything just feels like really I don't know.I guess it feels like more people you're kind of wiry.Everybody seems everyone seems kind of wiry and jittery and like a lot really quickly.But yeah, I mean, I definitely like was way more annoyed at people and are easier than I think I've ever been at say like Wiz con or one of the other cons I do.Like it's weird that I'm still sort of on the fence about it.Was it a good use of my time?I guess I think I'll just say if I didn't go I probably spend the whole weekend being depressed about it.If I didn't go and being like huh, but also going wasn't entirely great and the other thing was so due to some poor planning or timing on my part or whatever I end up.I wanted to leave the convention and run to my apartment Sunday evening.And so first I went to a friend's house.We were going to have dinner and someone was going to drop me off at my house and it didn't end up happening until later and they were really exhausted.So I was like, okay, I'll stay the night.And it's these friends of mine, and Damian who house is borderline hoarder house and it makes me super stressed partially their stuff piled everywhere and is really not places to sit and reminds me of an ex who had very similar piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff.But I like I would have skipped like I would have rather skip going over there for dinner, even though I did end up having a great opportunity to hang out with my friend Wanda for a couple of hours and blah blah blah.yeah, the hoarder House part just always makes me likeyeah, and then having the kind of pick your way around the big piles of stuff and then they decided to get for kittens recently, whichYeah, the only have two now they're getting two more and all I could think of is that's the worst idea ever.Also their apartment has wall-to-wall cream rugs.Yeah.I'm like this is not going to go well in the room where the kittens are right now.It's already like just grossed.It's covered in black cat hair and yeah, the other thing which is not related to me being angry at a sycon is a managed to I don't even know not noticed that the new semester had started for school.Yeah, and it started last week.So that's not too bad.But never actually done that I've gotten close by doing that makes me I sat down I think Friday and was like, oh the semester started well, fuck it.I'm not going to do anything with it this weekend and then I was like, okay, I'll sit down Monday and work on it and then didn't want to and then today I was just like, oh don't want to again.I'm part of it was I really miss calculated how so?So what to get together this weekend long something about multimedia stuff.It's kind of a conference in my library.So there's like keynote each day with a catered lunch like a bag lunch and workshops are discussions running every day.So it's like two workshops in the morning an hour-and-a-half keynote at noon and then afternoon Workshop, some are just talks Summer Jams on and so, you know, like I'm just completely not involved with it wasn't asked wasn't anything which like on the one hand.I don't like working with him either.I find a both insulting and kind of baffling you really just doesn't likeSuppose been really stressed about it, but hasn't asked me for any help.I offered to help he was just kind of likeso it feels frustrating and insulting and I'm also a little bit glad that I don't have to deal with it.But I guess part of the first rayshun is that people have been asking me lately?Oh, yeah that thing with your department that your Department's doing.Yep, I'm not involved.It's technically not my department.It's technically another group that's half of my apartment.And then I got reminded that the main multi media site at the doesn't list me as a member of the department.Yeah, let's turn multimedia consultants and Carl and Chet and then someone who doesn't work for the library and then some other people I'm just like what?Okay, the keto today was a postdoc of African-American studies and the sort of title was storytelling and African diaspora and African-Americans and multimedia.So I was pretty excited initially.They were supposed to have this other Professor who's amazing who has done data visualization about Haitian slave revolt and that was just super amazing and he's very interesting just so you know, I go trip in for the keynote and the postdoc is this white woman that I met before and I was just like, okay.This is a little weird.Maybe there was very low attendance and I was the only black person in the room and I feel like maybe there were two people who are white that also aren't US citizens if that makes sense from from Malaysian libraries.I'm just sort of like in the postdoc being white wouldn't necessarily have been a problem on its own and certainly met her before but it just all coalesced into me feeling really frustrated and uncomfortable and not being able to leave easily because her talk she was being filmed soYeah, it's just like, you know, I wish I had my laptop and then I could use the internet parts of what she was talking about.Her talk was disorganized and a lot of things part of what she was talking about was the African American studies sophomore seminars where they learn about how to do community outreach and how to do anthropological studies and interviews and blah blah blah.So it felt very weird to have a white woman telling presumably mostly black students how to study and talk to black people in the end that was kind of like the none of it.I was like, I was just like this very uncomfortable.Right, you know when reason I'm going to end up being sort of circular and it's similar to thoughts of like why are there a lot of women in it while they get harassed and it's really frustrating or seem to be inferior and they don't get hired.So why would you do that?I found her idea that just in couraging them through a sophomore seminar is fixing the problem to be incredibly naive.She's like one person's decided to do a secondary like to start CS computer science classes, so they can create a startup.I'm like computer science classes and startups have nothing to do with each other, which is probably part of why I didn't want to do anything with my class today also.Yeah, and also, I mean a lot of what she was talking about.I was like that's what I did as an undergrad in folklore and mythology some of these things that she was talking about.No sew some of the things she's talking about are things that I did as an undergrad in folklore and mythology.So like going out into the community and collecting stories and interviewing people.Yeah.Yes, so part of me was like I already know what you're talkin about.The other part of me is thinking what you're describing as being really Innovative.Is it so part of her this is so amazing and Innovative voice recording people on film.Well digital film.I was just kind of like I want to tell you film exist and it has for a while and it's interesting that they students try to turn them into videos, except they didn't do it very well.So that was kind of weird and then she had a whole about updating Wikipedia because Wikipedia doesn't have a lot of information about Africa African culture African diaspora type stuff and I think to me that was the only interesting part that's actually good because everyone uses Wikipedia for information again, there was something they were updating then another editor had been reverting.There was a little sort of tussle over something and right now says that the tussle had to do with one editor being more religious and conservative and that was what was causing the tussle, but I think the problem actually had to do it at least part Ethiopian politics and has been blamed for various bits of corruption or balance or there was something going on there.I was also wondering you know, who's that?It's regarding it.Are they Ethiopian?Are they not who's writing this are they be open or not and also asking one source for information and taking that as this is the truth, which we will update Wikipedia with is not really a great practice.Yeah, I feel like you're a postdoc at Cambridge but African come on and I'm kind of like part of me is like did you get him handed this last-minute?Were you not initially supposed to speak?Is this a failure to prepare?Do you really not understand the racial politics?Are you just not talking about them because you don't want to be controversial.I would think that accept that I think having a lot of white people who've done afro am chord just for I don't know I guess it seems like they just feel like what?Yeah, that's the truth.And also they feel like in their head.They're like, well I can tell whether or not something is racialized and if I don't think it is then it's not as opposed to like, huh?I should talk to someone else.Maybe my own whiteness is preventing me from seeking something seeing something.Yeah, I mean it's also possible to do.I'm curious what she studying what sheyeah, they're definitely people who have done things like focus on the Harlem Renaissance the literature of the Harlem Renaissance and then completely skip over the politics behind the Renaissance.I'm like, okay, I guess people do that like in literature departments and stuff, but it feels verySomeone in the English Department just focusing on the Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance ignoring politics making more sense than someone and afro and doing that.It was just a part of me is like, I don't know.Maybe she's dumbing it down for the audience or like parsley.It just seems baffling.I don't know.Yeah, I mean the part of the there was an overall issue of there was some incoherence to her talk with someone else mentioned.So like okay, it's not just me but I think you're definitely I had a hard time listening like she was supposed to talk about something like part of teaching them how to do these interviews.She's like well teach them how to get to Roxbury on the bus.I'm like really that's a weird statement.Also among the other things in that statement.It's like the Cambridge students not taking the bus not knowing how to get to a part area of town or areas where there's black people.There's a whole lot going on with that statement.And so I was thinking about that when she was sort of going on talking about something some other things at various point where I was just like, but how did you just say that soyeah, and also since I'm already familiar with the subject, basically, it's quite possible that if I was less familiar with it, although a co-worker of mine did comment on the bus to Roxbury thing without any prompting soYeah, it was just kind of weird.So I'll so it's going to be a whole week of this and I plan to be supportive and show my face and now I'm thinking, you know, I don't have to do that, especially since like, so there's been super low turnout people in the building haven't bothered to show so I think IYeah, okay.I was going to continue thinking on your comment ofCuz I just getting super critical because I was mad.Yeah, I don't know either but it's a big item to think of.In a good way.Okay.if they won they would have put San Francisco and I would have been in San Francisco for my the Super Bowl instead of at my grandma's 90th birthday party so nowyeah but they won't be in the Super Bowlso I had a real slap day yesterday just stayed in my PJs and slept on the couch and watch the inauguration all day and I went out to get Chinese food which I threw up this morningNice.Yeah, which is probably a good thing because I ate too much.Only when I order Chinese food because I eat too much.So it's still in my stomach, you know, 12 hours later 8 hours later whatever it's happened once before and I woke up yesterday.I had no no nausea whatsoever.So I was a little surprised because I figured I was dehydrated.From drinking but I decided against taking the adderal yesterday because that would have probably motivated me to do something.Sort of it's not that I didn't feel like getting anything done.I don't feel like doing anything, you know kids.If I take the adderal, yeah, you know like I'd go to the office and do something, you know, which I probably should have done.I'm going straight to the office from here.And I had motivated and made that decision before I took the adderal.But I definitely can tell the difference not too long after taking it like right now from how I saw, you know an hour ago.you know, it's like I'm just likeI might just you know too tired and this is giving me energy or is it really helping my focus and stuff like that?I thought about something that I was able to focus on a little better.I can't remember what it was.I think Ian was bothering me while I was doing what I was trying to do something.I can't remember.I did want to see the kids yesterday though.I was going to text Jess to see if they went and see when they were going to get back, but I never did.just forfor the day.Yeah and little friend moved cheese.There was call me when I can't take the call you no have to leave a message.And then when I did speak to them, you can't even remember the conversation like nothing was accomplished, you know, so I kind of ended up talking with Jess about what's going to happen with the house and she still suggests that I move into the house and that she take my apartment which now has one less room.I'm like, how are you going to fit in there, you know?No, that's their multi-family.Write what she wants to do is because my rents going down to 1200.She's not going to be able to get 1200 rent anywhere that isn't a slumlord or in a bad neighborhood.So she wants my 1200 rent, you know and for me to move into the house that's getting foreclosed on or short stay alert.I don't know why she wants me to move there, you know, butYeah, but I've been dreading talking about it and it wasn't so bad, you know just about what we were going to do as far as selling, you know, and I said I was going to do something see if they have an investment modification program.Maybe I'll call them today or tomorrow.Yeah, just to buy sometime, you know.Makanda litigation is just I'm on all these emails that I can't even read them.They're just so I don't even know what they're talking about.They're arguing over stuff and taking Hot Shots at each other.The disenfranchised trustee is, you know, both trustees gave me.Little bits to what the finances were or at least Riley did the guy who jumps eyes, so she thinks that you should be brought up on perjury charges because he no longer supports the litigation.I don't want to explain to her that you know, you didn't lie in the effect of it.He just doesn't want to enforce it, you know.They really need to either go into some sort of mediation or hire their own lawyers and sit with each other individually.I mean, I have to figure out how to extract myself from the situation.You know, Riley has not been communicating to me about at all about it.He just sent one email said he no longer supports the litigation and of course the email that I wrote out with her with our options likely I didn't talk about our trial strategy, but the disenfranchised women and sub emailing it to the defendant.I'm picking a trial date on Tuesday.We have a closing that morning.Probably not going to be able to meet with you on Tuesday.This coming Tuesday the 29th.Yeah.I know better today, but I think I've got a closing that morning.Yeah, if I remember but I pick Ian up today.Jess is taking some knitting class or something like that.You know, she complains that she has no time to get work done and she's so overwhelmed and you know, I don't know but taking a knitting class in the middle of the day.She takes all of Friday off with Lucille.Yeah, they've got a class at the school that they go to she's been trying to apply for the preschool program and get what's the word.They have a preschool program.I think they do.Yeah, trying to get financial aid.Yesterday was interesting because you know, I felt crappy all day, you know, and it wasn't so much bummed about the game.I mean, I'm sure that affected my mood some but just, you know lonely nothing to do just you know, I don't know.And I helped Ian felt his Pinewood car this car that I had no fucking clue what I'm doing went and bought some stickers for it numbers and flames and skulls and stuff like that little decals.He has a bunch of paint but I don't think he has the right paint to it.I don't know paint would I don't know they kind of don't give you a whole lot of Direction, you know.They're just like help you cut it and then they just like, all right, the way it is the way it is, you know, whatever.So there's no okay.She is what you need to do now or anything like that, you know, I don't think it's our Times Leader kind of a scatterbrain.There's not a clinical term for it.I just wonder if this thing was official.Jargon orback to the first thing.I do sorry for interrupting.That's part of one of the symptoms of ADD, soSo I do this thing what?fantasyIt wasn't about my anxiety.Just kind of something beyond my comfort zone, you know.I don't have really good woodworking or painting or any time of skill that requires making something using a toolNo.I made one when I was a kid, but I remember nothing about making it other than I won the silliest Car funniest car.I made like a Datsun, you know, I don't even remember why it was so funny and wants to win the silliest car, but we're not making a silly car.I don't know.When am I going to do that?Michaelsthey have a whole pile derby stuff.To give you a block and some Wheels.Yeah, they had a bandsaw Junior template on the car and they cut it.We actually have to add pieces of wood to the top to make it.You know, which is the part.I'm really more concerned about is, you know, making it look like a bumper car, you know.Just like the front Shield, you know, it has it kind of goes up a little bit and then there's like a back part, you know, just kind of a little it has to be built up a little bit.Write a lot of the cars are race cars where you go down and you know where this is your building it up.well, I don't wantI don't know.I don't know.If only it was a girl.Well, we'll find out.I don't know.I mean it's just you know.What?What?I don't know.I was thinking about something else.We already knew that how does that explain why I have a ton of laundry that I needed to do 2 weeks ago.I don't know.When do the bathroom Chinese food?Yesterday was Blue Monday the most depressing day of the year my whole life or something it was.the things that will happen, I don't haveI don't know.I just don't know.Yeah, I just have to confirm that the closing Tuesday, which I think it is.So I made the mistake of looking into my voicemail yesterday.I hadn't realized how long it had been since I really listen to it and I all those I was going to delete a whole bunch of messages.And so it made me listen to them before I could listen to anything else.So there were two messages from this guy with the ambulance company has been this whole thing where Blue Cross said, they weren't going to pay for any of the ambulance from one of those times one of the times I was in the hospital because it was like a non-emergency thing and even though so we had to write a grievance to them to say while I didn't have the option of refusing to take the ambulance.Yeah.And so that's been sent in and they've received it.Hopefully they'll pay for some of it at least but I had forgotten that that was sent in that we actually did that because I can't remember anything.So I just thought I'd been ignoring this guy from the ambulance company and then another message was I actually didn't make it through all the messages because I was freaking out too much.Yeah, I had to hang up.So I applied for this job as a substitute teacher in the city with the public schools like back in January or end of December.So I had a message from when I was in the hospital in January offering me a job interview.So that didn't happen.So, you know, I'm started freaking out just telling you about it.It was really freaking out listening to it.I got home and kind of fell apart and you know Jim's comforted me and everything.And that was the rest of the day like this happened right after my appointment with you yesterday and all I could do for the rest of the day with sit and read my book because every time I stopped and you know tried to actually get some work done or do anything I would just fall apart again.Yeah, I don't know how to live like this.It's like I spend so much of my energy not thinking about things while I mean, I can't deal with problems and then I don't haveThe attention that I ordinarily would have because you know a huge portion of my energy is going toward staving off this Panic that's there all the time.This morning was going okay, but I talked to Amanda on the phone and that was going okay, and she said she really thought that James and I should move to San Antonio and made a pretty good case for it just in terms of having a community, but I just couldn't handle that.I'm kind of trying to talk about anxiety and I feel like I've been trying to act like it's not as much of a big deal as it is, but it's just really devastating for me.I feel like it's crippling me.I'm so scared.I don't even know what I'm scared of.I'm just so scared.Yeah, I do.Yeah.I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of just getting into huge trouble over something.I never know what it is.I'll have forgotten about that turned out to be really important.I don't remember talking about that.Yeah, yeah.James you know at the end of the day, thank me for taking care of myself, you know for actually just saying well, I'm not going to be able to get anything done today.I just need to take a day off.Play felt so bad.I hate that.Yeah, I hate myself when I'm like that.I don't know why I can't just get over it.Or push through it or something.Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen the rest of the day.I really hate this.But I hope I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages and I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know.I know it's not that much to deal with but it feels like too much.My dad's coming home tomorrow.We'll see how that goes.Like I just want to hide.Yeah.No, not really.I just don't really have anything to say.I don't worry too much about you.I don't know.I'm not having much to say I think it's working pretty hard not to lose it right now.So I'm not really sure why.I mean, it's just because my nose runs so much.Just why is this happening to me?Why is this my life?Thanks.There's no reason for me to be so scared of everything.I just am.Shear I really don't want this.Going to go home, and I'm just going to keep going.It seems pretty bleak right now.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, we went to dinner with Franco.In Franco's friends, and I went really well and I felt better while we were there, but I really didn't want to go.Yeah.Yeah, I really do want to hear the reasons because that wasn't really a rhetorical question and I feel like I want to know and in other ways I feel like they're not going to give any reasons that are good enough.Yeah, nothing adds up.So I just want to stay away from it.I must have read 400 pages in the last 24 hours.And in other ways understanding doesn't necessarily help.It's interesting.It's distracting sometimes.It's hard for me to think about just the possibility that greater understanding wouldn't be helpful.I mean, I feel like it's kind of one of the foundational principles of life, but like knowing is better knowing will help.But know you're right.Yeah.No, you're right.I know I know why I reacted the way I do.Yeah.Yeah.Heck yeah.Yeah, but I don't want to be like that.fixI have no idea.I can't see you're wrong.Yeah.I mean, yeah, I want people to tell me it's going to be okay and I'll feel better.But you know, how dare theyOkay.Thanks.Yeah, it's good to be back.Makes it seem to me like it's working.So that's nice.I think the story is your supposed to call or refer me to them, but they won't do it until the ECT is done.Okay, that seems like it would be a good thing to yeah, she said apparently act we'll just like keep treating me.So I'm going to have to tell them to stop eventually.I don't know.The really sad.Oh well got to be back.I don't know.My psychiatrist in the hospital lives in next to me.Yeah.I don't know very Curt a little brisk.I guess it was okay.I'm relieved to be yeah.I'm not sure how much better I do feel but certainly better enough to be out of the hospital.That's a good thing.Yeah, that's a really good thing.Yeah, kind of.It could be I thought it is, but I don't ya.Yeah.I don't seem to have that many kind of much annoying side effects.Yeah.Yeah, I personally think that I think that's been okay.If I'm losing things I'm losing them completely enough that I don't know that it's gone, which is good enough.Okay.Yeah, I think it's working.No.Yeah.I guess I have the Impressions that I think I'm going to go back to being bad.I'm okay, I think.It's not like the most okay ever, but I think I'm okay.I don't know.I just don't know what to say.I'm pretty sad.That's about it.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I get worried about that.That's not necessarily the way I basically think.a little bitYes.I guess I just feel like I should just be able to let go of the anxiety.Yeah, seems like it.Yes.yeah, theYeah.Yeah.No, I mean that's not what you do.Yeah.I'm not sure like things are getting better with Sidney like when we talked after the fight.So I think the problem I guess is my tone of voice when I'm mad at him and because like when we get into an argument, you know, and he says I'm yelling at him.I'm like, I'm not yelling.He's like, well you sound really upset.And I'm like, I am really upset like I mean, I guess it's solution then is to figure out how to fix my tone of voice.Not always like I mean I used to think I sound mad but I don't think I sound like more mad that I am or really super duper mad.And I just don't know if it's like, you know part of me is like will I'm angry and I want you to know it but then again that's just hurting him.SoI don't know.I told him well, why don't you record the next fight we have and then I can listen to my voice, but I don't know if that would like I guess I have to but I think the only way to change it is to like be more patient while being mad like it seems like the only wayYeah, because then he shuts down and it's like he's not listening to me and then he gets mad because I'm repeating myself.I'm like, but you're not listening to me you're shutting down and not letting me talk interrupting me.That's not really going to work.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, it's just that then.I don't know what to do other than try to be calm when I'm not come in like a fight is happening.I'm very much not cam.Maybe I mean last time it was in the context of trying to wake him up on Saturday morning and Friday night.He did staying where he likes it up late and then likeMondaynext Friday.Yeah, I'm like we had this conversation you promised you wouldn't you promised you take Ambien before you were, you know, trying to stay up late whatever because first you wanted to get a snack.He was like listening to some lecture when he got snack and then he like got up again until I shower and shave and he took the Ambien right before he showered and shaved as opposed to taking Ambien before he got the snack at like, you know, so he takeLike 4 a.m. Or whatever instead of 2 a.m. Or something and like it was at least a two hour time difference.If not longer I think is going to win and he could have taken it but like, you know, he's acknowledged that he's like, you know, he's told me before that.He wouldn't do it again and he doesn't again is just like so frustrating.I'm like, why do you keep on doing this because he's like no being so immature like he doesn't want to face the day or whatever you want some alone time right now at like really late but then it like impacts our plans for the next day like things he promised.It's like really hard for me to deal with and so like, you know, it was in the context of trying to wake him up at morning and maybe I should have been nicer about it when I woke him up, but I was just so pissed that he wouldn't wake up.I had to wait like another two hours before I could do anything because like he needed more sleep, but you needed more sleep.It was his own fault.Well one thing he promised me we'd actually make out because we had him for like weeks and because he was up for it on Friday night, but then he was too tired.And so he was like, I definitely want to tomorrow and then he was just like sleeping and I sort of knew that I mean granted.This is like a bunch of stuff.So like in the past when something like this has happened when I let him sleep in he's going to be hungry for lunch and not want to do anything and then after lunch help someone of eating too much I need time to digest in like, you know, we're not feel good and then nothing will ever happen and he'll change his mind and I have been weeks and I was kind of going crazy or at least a week at that and it in like a week and a half or two weeks.I just made me feel like his desire to watch like listen to those lectures that night at that point was more important than like being intimate with me.Yes, it is and he feels pressure.But I'm like it's sort of hard not to like, you know.Yeah, like you know, it'd be one thing if I knew like going into this relationship that he had really low libido.But like when he's not depressed he doesn't and he's starting to get better.But then he had like a cold that like, you know, he's had for 3 weeks and said that making things hard even if he is getting better mentally like he's not better physically andYeah, like he ended up being awake for New Year's Eve, but we didn't get to do anything romantic mostly because he was sick and said I was a disappointment.He was like, oh we can do something romantic later in the week.I was like, okay that never happened either.But again, I guess he keeps on thinking he'll feel better and then he doesn't so there's like nothing I can really do about that.At least I got him to go to the doctor and I did and he actually liked called and made an appointment.He called last Wednesday, then he had the appointment last Thursday and they did like a bunch of tests and he doesn't have mono or strep or anything, but he did because of its debilitating cost they give him inhaler to use if he's coughing too much and that's actually been helping soYeah, I'm really glad he finally got over the whole not seeing the doctor thing.And then he's like should I go in for an actual check up?And I'm like, yes, you haven't had one in three years.So I sometimes we make progress but sometimes we still fight in like, you know, I was just so afraid on Saturday that like, you know, maybe we'll never be able to figure it out and like I don't know a good solution other than don't sad mad when I'm mad or like I have to keep everything in until I feel more calm which like I guess is a mature adult thing to do.But like I feel like then I don't actually get to Express Pipe and frustration.Yeah.Yeah, it's not a word that he really use either.It was just more.He said you know that I keep on hurting him.So it's hurtful I guess which is even worse than disrespectful butI guess he doesn't like when I'm angry at him and he thinks it you know, I mean, I don't like when people are angry at me.I guess the difference is it feels likeyeah, so I don't know what to do and it's not like I'm taking out my frustrations on from something else on him.I'm taking my frustrations at him.Yeah, and it just really bothers me.He says I'm sorry.I'm like, okay, you said that the last time to you know, and it's not I'm not yelling.I'm not raising my voice like I wasyeah.Which I am.Because I'm annoyed at him because he keeps on doing the same things over and over again while promising not while promising not to do then it's just like how do I trust you?If you don't ever follow through on your promises, which I guess it's in overgeneralization.It's not like she never follows through butYeah.Yeah.I guess I'm the only one who can because you know, and I told him before that like if he says he's sorry, that just makes me more angry.Because I don't believe him, you know, I think he just sorry that he did something that made me angry but not that like or that he whatever he did made me angry, but not that like that whatever.He did made me angry, but not like necessarily for whatever he did because he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong, but it's like impacting.I guess he doesn't he thinks that I'm being the detrimental one by getting mad.I mean somewhat he I don't know I guess what the staying up late then he thinks he's an adult he's entitled to do that and like okay, but if you make promises from the next day and stuff, it's really frustrating and like he does admit sometimes that some of the stuff he does is self-destructive, especially because he's an insomniac I'm trying to fix that like you need to get a regular sleep schedule.If you're going to try to get out of her out of depression and but like, you know, so there's sometimes he thinks they're right and sometimes he doesn't think they're right and whereas I usually think I'm right because it's not an isolated incident.It's a chronic feeling of not mattering sometimes and yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, so there's no way to fix it then, right?butI can try to respond more, but I don't think I'm going to get any less like mad about it.Like I have the right to be mad.He's like you can't be mad at me.Don't be mad at me and I'm like, you know, I'm allowed my emotions.So all I can really do is just not respond right away andNo, he said it's just that it's not okay to be mad about something.I'm like, I have the right to he doesn't say why you know, I guess maybe because he can't do anything wrong.But like I have the right to be upset, I guess maybe because me being mad hurts him but like he's doing things to make me mad.And he was like asking about me and do I have problems with anger management?Like I don't I'm not yelling at him.I'm just in a pissed-off tone of voice because that's what I am and I'm not not calling him names.I'm not hitting him or throwing things or even raising my voice.But like it's just the tone of my voice.yeah, and so I guess like what I have to be dishonest orit makes me a little annoyed that I have to do this in the first place and I can't just express my anger and then deal with it, but likeAnd it just feels like it's just like I feel sometimes like I'm the one doing everything.Yeah.Yeah, you know things like taking care of him and making food and doing all these things that like, you know, when I was sick and he was panicking I was still do things for him.You know, I would still make him food and even when I was sick or like do crazy things like emptying the dishwasher at his place standing on a chair while dizzy, which I really should not have been doing and things like that, but when he's sick and I'm panicking because he's sick.I still have to do all these things even though in the river situation.I did all those things.Like I just I'm taking care of him a lot more than he's taking care of me and it's just really frustrating.So yeah, I can't really do anything though.Like, you know, like if I don't cook then we don't get food and you know, I don't want him to start but I don't want him to starve and I don't want me to starve so, you know all sorts of things that I just feel like I'm doing everything.I mean in reality, I guess I'm not doing everything.Sometimes he does things but I think I still think it's pretty unbalanced.Yeah, it's not like I take down and write every time I cooked or he's cook dinner for me or stuff so I could be wrong about this, but I don't think I am.Yeah.Yeah, and like he's been depressed for almost a year.Like that's a really long time.I mean it's not his fault because like he's at least it's not like he's been avoiding therapy and drugs or anything like that.He's he has appointments.He makes them he goes to them.I mean granted a lot of his therapy has been phone sessions because he's been feeling sick, but he still usually goes to his therapy twice a week, but it'sYeah.Yeah.I mean, I guess more when it impacts my plans for the next day.So it is kind of selfish because if he needs to sleep in on another day and I don't need him for anything that I get that I'm not mad about it and I can let it go but when it impacts plans that we would be doing together and then I have to work around him because he stayed up all night is just really tiresome.Yeah.I mean, I think most of it's just stems from his his depression.That's like why I've been staying is because he can get better from that depression eventually he will and then he won't be like this anymore.I mean something's might still be the same but like he won't you know, the low libido won't be an issue anymore.And I mean, I guess I'll still be insomniacs, but if I can separate my plans from his I think me having a job would also help things a lot because then I would be getting out of the house and stuff.Yeah, except I yeah, I'm still not up for the past 3 weeks.I have stuck with the one application a week.Yeah.Except that I have been gone and I actually did get two emails from two different positions that I applied to that.I did not get the position.Yes.Yeah.No, I'm going to call I mean they sent they said like skipped a week of Christmas and New Year's.So I'm going to call I don't know maybe tomorrow or something, but they've not come through with anything yet.Yeah.though my parentsmy mom seemed kind of skeptical when I told her I'm doing one application a week, but I'm like it's more than I was doing before.That's all I can do right now.So I almost have applied to two jobs last week.Like there were two that I could have applied to but the other one the website to apply for them was like so slow and broken.I was just like screw this and not spend and written a cover letter yet.So like I you know, so it wasn't like I spend on whatever only to not lie, but it was just you know, it's it's one thing to have a really application where you have to fill out the things and basically like replicate your resume and he asked you for your resume to but at the site won't even load that's my point of giving up because I don't want to sit and wait for 3 hours for website to load and wonder if the application even got in so I don't actuallyAnd then that one was posted on like the like archives listserv thing anyways, so a bunch of other archivist.We're also applying so I think it was the end of the world not to apply for it and it was it wasn't something that I was like really really excited about so I think yeah, I think slow websites counts as a like a legitimate reasons not quite something.I mean, I applied to something else that day.So I was so I still fulfill my one a week.Yeah, it's not really working to get me past.Yeah, and I guess my dad sent me to the email.It was like, oh give your resume to this person her husband might have might know things about a job, you know thinking about my dad.I was like what the hell like but I didn't say anything.All I did was read the person sent her my resume and told her like I'm his daughter blah blah blah and she said she would send it to her husband.I don't really know what kind of job like a lead on a job.Like, what does that in my field outside my field admin assistant thing retail.I don't know like he gave me absolutely no information and like and does this person even actually want me to send the resume, but Iyeah, I mean I could have sent it and then engagement arguing with my dad, but I didn't I just sent the resume and the woman was like oh, yes, I'll forward it to my husband and I haven't heard anything sinceother than being annoyed and my dad being like when he sends me stupid things that make no sense like internship internship that doesn't mention anything about being paid at like this Jewish girl school, which has absolutely has nothing to do with my field.Also, it's all the way out and nowhere and then like then I have to drive and it's I don't know like if an internship doesn't say it's paid and doesn't say it unpaid is the Assumption or is there not an assumption you can makeYeah, if something were in my field or remotely close to what I want to be doing it would be one thing but it's like when my mom sends me job.Sometimes they at least make sense, but my dad sends me jobs.They never make sense.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.If something is a paid position don't you think it would be to their advantage be like this is a paid internship because you know more people would be likely to apply if it were paid and unpaid.Like if I had a paid internship offer, I would be like here is this internship?It is paid with a stipend with x amount of money or something.trueBut they might be trying to get good people to apply.Yeah.And is it okay to send that sort of email to son?Haha.Yeah, I think that's compensation something listed a while ago.Like is it are you still taking application?So I guess it wouldn't be much different than that.But yeah, I don't know.Maybe I should stop it up to two week.I don't know.Milk have not.Maybe I don't know.But my behavior affects him a lot less than his effects meat.And I'm applying to one job per week.And I don't see part of me thinks that the incentive I guess because I'm just thinking maybe I don't deserve a trip if I don't have a job.So why set up a system if I'm you know why I get rewarded for, you know, writing an application a week or whatever if they don't actually result in me getting a job.Does that make sense?Yeah.hahaOkay.No.Okay.trueSo far, all I can really do is just guilt myself and Hope.Maybe not.I mean I've I don't know it's just hard.I'm also like a little bit sick and not makes it hard to I guess just I don't know maybe the when there's something I want to do.Okay, I will just do this your job application first then do like I think more immediate.Works better than something in a long-term, but like I don't necessarily always have that there.Like today where I wanted to dye yarn and like I did that after I sent out the application.Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing I could theoretically do is like dedicate one day a week for like spending, you know, 8 hours of that day looking and applying for jobs.And one day we spent doing yarning stuff for my store like dying things like and then I'd only be working 2 days a week and the rest of the time I could do whatever and I would still be more than I was doing for either of those things.It's just that I sort of lack the discipline too, and I'm like, okay or I could just do the one job a week which seems like a lot less than that andI don't know like maybe Sydney couldn't Theory.I don't know if you would I could ask him but like some things also are location-based.Like I can only do I can only dye yarn if I'm at my place and not when I met his place.Sort of I mean yes or no, like I can borrow his car and just go there but like if we were like, oh, we're going to sleep at my place tonight then it's like oh I'm too sick to go over and then I'm like, okay fine.We stay at your place another night.And you know, it's a lot harder to motivate myself to go over to my place and I yarn then already buy it my place and then dye yarn because it's a whole like 15 minute drive to my place and I have to try back.I guess it's not that long of a drive but like it's stillYeah, well, assuming not rush hour, but it's enough to stop me from just doing it.I mean that also could be the I mean I've gone to my place for a few hours and dyed yarn, soI don't know I could apply for jobs when I met his place and dye yarn when I'm at my place or something.But as of yet, I haven't gotten a good system to motivate myself.Other than the you know, I will five one job a week system whichYeah.Yeah, but right now I'm like having trouble finding a job for to apply to this week.It's Monday.That's true.But I usually try to get it done early in the week so I can enjoy the rest of the week.Yeah, I really don't know what else to do though.It's either that or or possibly maybe I could go back to volunteering.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.It might and then I'll get out of the house in like at least be doing something.Yeah, not that I'm necessarily that productive, but that's okay.Yeah, that's true.Yeah, just don't want to volunteer forever.Because I would drive me insane.like I could volunteer on top of a job depending on what that job is butIt's just annoying.I don't have something else to do because now it's been over a year that I've been unemployed and like I really didn't think I'd be unemployed this long.Yeah, like I really thought I'd find a job.And I haven't in like that.I don't know the economy is getting better, but it's like right now only getting better in terms of like stock prices, which only really helps the people who have stocks and like that doesn't always translate into jobs.I feel really stupid.Like maybe I shouldn't have gone into like Library science and archives.Maybe I should have completely changed my focus to something more practical that like actually had job, but the thing things that do have jobs are like, you know, I don't even know anything at this point.Any further education is only going to make me over qualified for things in my field and like I can't like start another bachelor's degree till I get a degree in computer science or something because I would be really expensive and I don't really like programming because I'm not very good at it.But like I don't know what else to do or like, you know, go get an associates degree because maybe that would make me better.I get an administrative assistant jobs who goes and gets an associate's degree after they've already on the Masters.I don't know just like sending one job application a week isn't really working either.I need to think outside the box and do something crazy, butYeah, just wondering if well, I don't know.I just also don't think I'm unless it was a Ph.D program that had a stipend.I don't think I could justify going for another degree because they would cost money.Even if there was something that would like, you know, if I want to get a museum studies degree as well that would cost money and I've used up all the money in my college fund at this point.So I'm not entitled to any more degrees soUnless I got a PhD in museum curator ship and that which case that would help me for another four or five years and then come out and have even possibly a tougher time finding a job.I don't know.It's like really unfortunate.I just feel so trapped because all I can really do is send out job applications and it's not really doing anything and I'm stuck.Yes.Yeah, everytime.I try to think it true.I can't think of anyone.That would be a good person to talk to.I know people working place with the exception of you know, I know people who are working at libraries and that is great except that because the system is so centralized that they had the same HR department like doing interviews for all of our University like a mic having been told when I was working at 1 department and asked about it if like I was to apply to somewhere at the University, you know, when knowing that help and they say they don't get to see the applications or anything until it's like whatever stage, you know, maybe like the last round of interviews or something or at least, you know, it would be after initial interviews definitely not like so they wouldn't necessarily be able to pull my name from the pile unless I somehow I guess if I knew someone who is friends with someone who was in the HR department at the school.I think that would be the only way I don't know anyone who is friends with people in HR and I don't really know the people in HR and they like to keep all that information top secret and stuff.So the networking thing I think you know, yeah, I don't know people who work in other libraries that I'd want to work in or yeah.That might I don't know.It's also been a while since I'd like to talk to any of the people, you know, and really the only people at is the Divinity School library.That was because I you know volunteer, I guess also the that we gave to her.If I see a job there I can like talk to the people, but it's like until I see that job.It seems like I'm begging, you know, please give me a job or talk to someone especially because you know, it's one thing to talk to the person, you know, and ask if they can like ask for you, you know, they can vouch for me but like the next person in that line doesn't know me.Yeah.Okay.Yeah.I guess if I can find a least scary people to email that if I had because a lot of people I might be like, oh, it's been so long so long time sinceand when networking thingOkay.I think so.I guess I might substitute secondly scary networking thing if I can't actually find a job to apply toBecause so far I haven't done anything to apply to.Yeah.Yeah Orwell name and where they might be from.becauseokay.Okay, still nothing from the insurance.Okay.Okay, so wait another 6 weeks sort of thing.Okay.That's good that it wasn't a dial.That makes me grateful.Yeah, more panic attacks and stuff.It was really Cindy who wanted me to get the extra appointment.So I said sure because it was starting to get really rough on him because it wasn't like I wanted to hurt myself.It was me asking him like trying to convince him that it would be that he'd be better off if I were dead and stuff, which I guess I like something that's really hard to listen to.that's how I feel when I'm in that much panic and I'm trying to rationalize it because I'm just like there is no way to make it better other than to not experience anything anymore and like right now I'm not panicking butI don't want to hurt myself right now because I'm not panicking.So I thinking normal.But yeah.Yeah, I mean he knows that I'm actually not going to hurt myself.Oh, what's the difference?Like when he gets really crazy like he's done things like hitting his head on the floor something.He drives himself from like trying to bash his head in on the wall, but still I'm not likeSure.I know that I'm not going to do it.I'm pretty sure he I mean I guess there was a point like on Tuesday night where I like went to the bathroom and was there for like a little while and said he was like wondering what happened to me because he has all the shaving stuff is in his bathroom.And so he thought that I like my trying to hurt myself, which really, I was just taking a while in the bathroom and hadn't even occurred to me that the shaving stuff was in the bathroom.So like that was like the one time that he was really like worried.But I didn't do anything.I don't think it makes it worse.I think it's sort of like I have this urge to talk about it.So like it's me being weak, I guess and guess it's like lately.I've been trying to be better about and stuff butOh the fact that I gave in instead of just not saying anything at all.I mean not that Sydney wants me to like not telling what I'm feeling this way, but I guess I could do it in a more productive way.Not asking if I could kill myself, but just be like by the way, I feel like I want to hurt myself right now.I don't know because I feel like if he did give me permission to kill myself.That would probably make him a very bad boyfriend.At least not now but when I feel like that like I mean, I guess I would if he were to give me permission to like her myself like in a way that wasn't permanently damaging.It could figure out that out like that would be something that would actually be productive because then I thought I don't even know that hurting myself in a non permanently destructive way.Would even like actually do anything to temporarily relieve the pain it just my brain thinks it will end but like he isn't even okay with that.So it's not like I'm going to change his mind on anything.maybe if it wasn't permanently damaging or even like damaging at all like just momentarily cause pain like I don't see the problem with it, you know, if it wasn't something that could become dangerous like I'm really liking the things that could do it but likeyeah.Yeah, they're really like so many injuries that people get that.They like immediately recover from you know, I feel like they concerned with cutting yourself.Not that I could do that with the whole and cutting is that like the concern becomes that you're going to cut yourself too much too much blood comes out there going to get an infection that there will be scars on your body or that you'll like, you know, what the wrong way and I bleed out likeBut if you do it correctly that way you could avoid all these risks and not actually permanently damn the scars which you can't really avoid.Well, it's not like anything I'm currently doing is really effectively managing the panic.Like I've been on the reduced while Butrans and it's not so this is like the 6th day of being on reduce Wellbutrin and like I can't really see much of an effect like it isn't making me worse.So I guess that's a good thing.So it's like I just wanted to reduce the Wellbutrin anyways, soLike it's sort of like I guess the Panic often it won't start until mid-afternoon perhaps earlier, but if so happens it still happens almost every day.If not every day.I'm not sure because they're like at least a couple but then again maybe you could consider them like, you know, if I don't get a describe distraction that it's one panic attack just a very long panic attack, you know, and then I guess like when I have a rehearsal and stuff, okay, so I have a panic attack right before her so go to rehearsal feel fine for rehearsal get out of rehearsal another panic attack.Yeah.Yeah, like last night yesterday.I was like able to hold out for until 4 ish or so and then even then I was still able to like something like cuz normally panic attacks like prevent you from going out about your day today life and mine don't.Like I can still do things like I still was like, okay.Well, you know, I need a lock and someone bought one for me.So I'm going to walk to the post office drop off these packages.and I could do it andI was panicking while I was doing it, you know and still panicking when I was at the theater and like adding photos about the aren't things to put up on my store and panicking, you know, when I was sending emails and stuff and I guess I didn't do that much.I did some productive things.I guess.I went grocery shopping, but that was before the Panic it started and oh we went to the store and I was still panicking then and we drove home like we had to go to his house to get some packages that he had gone.And so we went to the store on the way there then you know, and he was driving there to the store and then to his place but then on the way back he asked if I could drive because he's not really good with night driving and it was really really tired and I was like, okay.Well, you're really really tired and I'm just panicking and I drove home and managed to drive home without hitting anyone or doing anything on safe and park the car all-out Panic Game.Yeah.I don't know.I guess I was sort of focusing on the road.But like, you know, there was still that underlined uncomfortable feeling inside me.That was anxiety and like it was very much still there and I was aware in like, okay, I'm driving this car while I'm panicking so I don't know how I did it.I just did things because I had to I think that's usually the way things happened to me so that if I can get anything productive done, it's like because it has to be done.Well, then I didn't feel it all I think the thing is like it can only it has to be something that takes up my entire like Consciousness and stuff driving.I can still think about other things walking to the post office I think about other things and so there I can just do these things while panicking whereas rehearsal like once I get into his like, you know takes up all myyassoYeah.Yeah, but it's like I don't know like sometimes I have more control than others.But like, you know, like I don't control whether or not I have rehearsal that's like based on the semester and stuff and whether or not we have a concert coming up.So, you know, I had it Tech last week this week.I only have rehearsal on Tuesday night becauseMaybe I don't know whether or not there would be enough to because they're not like something doing productively today like after this.I have an interview for the like I'm actually finally interviewing at the temp agencies.Yes, that was on purpose.So like maybe they'll be able to start me with something as soon as Monday if they could that would probably solve the problem at least while I'm at work and then I guess I'll have to deal with the panic in the evenings, butBut of course that also assumes that work is something that doesn't take, you know to take a nap in my brain because I was just thinking like if I'm at work like especially now that I like finished actual project I needed to finish like if I'm just coming and he'll like do whatever like I don't know like hair is very talkative.So if I end up wasting time and talking to like Terrence F then like be occupied enough, so yeah, it depends on it really depends on what I do because lots of things still take up all my brain like last night when I was panicking said he was like, why don't you try knitting I was like, okay, I guess and I like try knitting and it did absolutely nothing which is what I figured it would because it wasn't really taking up enough my brain.So like I don't know if getting together cuz like hanging out with Sydney is not enough to make it go away most of the time even if we're like watching a TV show or something the Panic still there.I guess there has to be something where I'm like actually required like because of her son required to do things.You know, I have to sing can just stand there.SoI don't think so.Like I really don't think there's anything that trigger is like it just happens and then I just filled the physical thing feeling and then I'm just like, oh no not again, like the feeling doesn't come there's nothing that comes before the physical feeling as far as I can tell like I've never been so I'm pretty sure it's just happening and not being triggered by anything.It didn't last night like, you know, I started like whenever we got home at like, you know, maybe like before midnight like I took my nighttime meds which included the Klonopin like when I got home and then I was still up for like another hour or so panicking and the Klonopins and nothing immediately.So, you know, which leads me to believe that if I had, you know earlier I taken a quarter Klonopin the same thing would have happened where it wouldn't have done anything mediately.SoI don't know like I guess it doesn't and used to help but not like if it does it doesn't such a subtle way that like it doesn't help immediately help as I could see working right away.Okay.Yeah that didn't happen last night.yes, which also didn't happen last night or any night, soYeah.He's been doing better other than we've gone into a couple of fights last couple of days.Like when I've been all panicky and like taking it out on him and I feel bad about doing that andYeah, I mean, sometimes he still has problems like doing things like getting out of the house, but in general like he's been doing a lot better than he had been.Because he's doing better and I'm doing worse.I don't think so.I guess it could be that but the Panic would have been there all along and I just been holding it back like, you know when you get if you're in school and you get sick right after finals because your body is like had been fighting it off for like a half semester and then all the sudden it's like where you've got to get sick.SoYeah, so maybe I mean that's entirely possible, but I didn't make the connection err.possiblyYeah, it's really hard on that.We're hoping that fixing the other issues, you know, but at temp I'm making like however much you know, they let you put a like however much you would want.And so I put my minimum it like 13 hours.So if I was working 40 a week like I would be enough to support myself.Because I wouldn't be dependent on my parents and I could buy all the things I could finally properly yell at them for not giving their employees health insurance because they would no longer be like, oh, well you're profiting from this and I'd be like not anymore and it would have to deal with them.Yes, though.And just not feeling guilty every time I have to spend money on anything like isn't a necessity.And then also the whole getting out of the house and having something to do.I mean there was the same last week.I haven't really tried this week because I've been well there was the whole getting back and forth temp agency and in the whole Panic thing, soWrite a cover letter.Yeah, I mean I used to have like, you know, I get out of here and my thing is at 12:30 and it'll take like maybe 20 minutes to get down in the downtown crossing so I can theoretically like look and see if there was one thing to write a cover letter for but the deadline would have been forSo I'm not actually been looking for things.Yeah, but I couldn't be right one cover letter.Maybe if there's something that there's probably something.Yeah.Question.Should I be like looking into cognitive behavioral therapy group thing?Okay, so would that like be?Okay, so basically all the stuff I end of fighting against okay.Yeah.because I feel that I'm smarter than them andWrite a note these.They're like ones that were trying to put in my head to be more useful, but they're not necessarily true.And therefore I'm trying to believe something that isn't true or isn't the whole truth and I can't make myself do that.I would probably pick comfortable but likeI don't have the ability to because I'm to focus on being right and I don't have the ability to I don't know if I want to be comfortable though at the expense of believing something.That isn't true.If I I don't have that sort willpower to believe something that isn't true.I'm too skeptical.Well, sometimes I am but it depends on the situation.Yeah, maybe I'm too stubborn to choose comfort in like stubborn.Yeah, just because I'm so stubborn, you know strongly believing that I'm right with things like therefore.I have trouble believing that there might be other options when I know that I'm right.Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like I'm right it could also be like the depression lying to me butWell, I don't know just like in general depression wise to the self.So I mean it's like I know there are times when I know I'm not right.I mean like when I'm feeling like oh, I would be better off if I were dead.So I mean there's the rational part of my back in the back of my mind.It's like no that's not true.That's just those depression lying to you.I guess sort ofI'll just say yes thinking making me think that this Panic is so bad that I wish I could die over it or telling me that if I hurt myself it will make me feel better which probably always wasn't trueyeahthat will theoretically this anxiety isn't actually worth killing myself over and that it will go away eventually it just doesn't feel like it will go away eventually because here I am you know doing my best to be productive and trying to do all the responsible things and not getting anywhere with it like it's just so frustratingBut it still feels like it's you know, because like I feel like I shouldn't be kept on something by now, like shouldn't a medication change which I guess it has if there's stuff like like, okay now, I'm not panicking every morning.I'm just you know, it pushes it off until the afternoon and maybe I should call again and ask her about levels what if I took half in the morning and half in the afternoon and split it up more?I guess it's like my whole understanding of the situation is you know, like how am I going to work then?Because like, you know when I take the medicine at night that I'm supposed to take at night that's supposed to help with the pain making out and then an hour later.I'm still panicking.Maybe it's not I would have been Panic even more and maybe I'm panicking last but I'm just panicking so much that I can't tell the difference.you know, like if my Panic level was at 200 and now is at like 2:50, and soYeah.Yeah.Yeah, but yeah, I guess the other question is also like did I ever do the whole like signing the waiver for you to talk to?Dr. Barnes about the medicines?Okay.I thought I did.I was just double.Checking.Okay, I assume I find it on her intookay.Okay, that makes sense.I guess I should call her this afternoon.It's like I don't have an appointment with her until the 19th, which is like another almost two weeks.So are there for like that's still another two weeks of?Not really like it was just step 1 Step 2 and then wait till then.Yeah, it was just a week, you know, okay, so I did the you know switching to a lower Wellbutrin like a day or two early, but now it's been almost two weeks since the appointment with the week of the Klonopin the week of the lower Wellbutrin, like lowering the Wellbutrin stops the taking more Klonopin.It's one at a time.So, yeah, I guess I could call her and ask about the intermediate stuff spreading out the Klonopin more and whether or not it would work because like I think it's like, you know low enough that it doesn't like cause me to be too tired during the day.I have been I mean I've gotten tired lately but not in the morning when I take two Klonopin.I think it's more just like all the Panic is making me tired.Like last night.The other thing was when I took a Klonopin at like midnight whatever and I ended up going to bed at like 12:30 or something.And then I was able to fall asleep just fine.And then I woke up at 2:30 and was like completely and totally awake and panicking.And I was able to get back to sleep until again after that and that's how I slept through the rest of the night kept on waking up in the middle of the night is really frustrating.I don't think it took me too long.You know, I got up till I go to the bathroom.A little bit because he had also woken up but I don't think he woke me up and then I had him go downstairs and get me a towel roll because also I had been feeling like a little bit of stomach acid trying to reduce all that and so he went downstairs and got me a whole the role that we split it and so ate my half and then I was able to go to sleep but there's no way to prevent myself from waking up in the middle of the night.Really.maybe I guess I could ask if I could take some sort of like Sydney takes Ambien, but I there was one time I took one of his Ambience and that was like the night I was trying to sleep when I was like super duper sick and throwing up.And I ended up throwing up the Ambien but likeNo, but I'm having trouble staying asleep.So I don't know if sometimes in general I don't but with the panic and also has made it harder to fall asleep to.Will sleeping more help and general things.Yeah, so that's when I like I could take as needed.It wouldn't be like taking every night.Okay.Steel ValleyHolding my breath for four was a little bit Disney now.It shouldn't have fun.Yeah, but like I seen I've had to do holding, you know, you see my air for a lot longer than that.It's from sitting down and stuff.Yeah.I guess.Okay.Yeah, I like to breathe in and out before I get that extra for for holding it because yeah, I guess I'm used toheading out over a long.Of time.Like there's no.Yeah.Oh wow.So I defended my dissertation.Thank you.It went fine.It was not the best presentation I've ever given but it was good enough.So I got the dissertation done early Friday morning food, Ohio and Sunday made my slides and I finish those Tuesday morning and then give the fuck an hour later.So not the way I would recommend doing it to anyone, but it got done.Yeah, it's a big milestone.Yeah, we talked some last week about why it was it.Why didn't finish it on Tuesday when it was do we talked about trusting the system and kind of other things like that.I think there's pieces of that involved that I think one important piece is that I was trying to do something that was at the edges of what was possible in terms of like 2 weeks before that.I had nothing for my dissertation and my paper separately.So I simply put everything into the dissertation and ruin half of it entirely in the two-week period or two and a half way.Because it took me a little longer so I wouldn't really recommend that either but that was what I did and I feel like there's an important question and why did I do that there and some of that is related to the deadline so forth but part of his I have a difficult time estimating how long something is going to take sometimes I do things like this where that should not have been possible but I did it that makes it harder to ask me the next time.How long is that task going to actually take I have no idea how long that has should have taken out.All I can say is that it took a whole lot of work and I didn't not so there's a piece there's also I didn't want to reschedule it.I didn't want to because that's a little less clear why I really really didn't want to reschedule.It.It was like there's a household rescheduling to get all the right people in the same room at the same time.Most of it I think was I think I felt like rescheduling it would be admitting defeat us onDespite the not really.Not really being true in any meaningful sense and I felt like my circle of close friends has had a lot of negative incidents in the last year.You know, Tanya has been hospitalized multiple times and left her program Frank almost died almost to apply for faculty job and then had to not because it was driving him crazy.I felt like in substance the people around me needed success and I needed a success for me.And so I thought you might find that interesting.So I shared that with you, but you don't have to find that interesting.That's okay.I feel like there's probably some overlap in the tropics but maybe notin one of the ways those two things overlap is that you suggested you were trying to help me figure out what I need is so I feel like that description at least Bears on that whether or not it actually is about whether I need to talk about it I feel like what I just said describe some piece of me in a way that might be helpful in that task for you that might've sidestepped entirely what you were trying to get upRights that felt like an important thing to say here.Other than that.I'm not really sure and there's a sense in which like me recognizing us is going on is important but then I don't really need to tell you but I feel like it's more helpful.They do tell you when I notice things like that or feel like that's how things are going in an information-gathering sense.I think but I'm not sure.That's really interesting.I don't know.I tend to feel like less of my experience should be private here than I often maintain elsewhere.But I hadn't really thought of it in terms of privacy.You're looking at me very intently.Okay, you're allowed to look at me intently.I don't mind.Yeah.So the following week has been a little bit strange.So yeah a whole lot of people have been excited for me and congratulatory and all of that it took me most of Wednesday to fly back most of Wednesday to fly back last week because when I booked the flights, I was a lot of traffic I had sort of thought that I would be very pleased afterwards and certainly after I finish the dissertation and sent it off.I had very Lake intensely peaceful feeling that was really nice.It lasted about 10 hours.So I slept for four of those and then after about six hours of being awake, I felt like I really had to start making travel plans for how is getting in to Ohio.And then what size was I going to prevent the most after I defended I felt tired because I haven't slept very much last couple of days.So on Wednesday, I was more rested and also I felt something closer to like I guess there were kind of two separate things one was like lost purpose.It's like it's been a very intense and focused experience and clarifying in some way.That's nice.And so there was sort of some sense of loss and not going away.It's so clear.What I need to do next but there's no urgency to it.Even if the urgency was entirely artificial and mostly self-imposed.The other thing was sort of like a dread of coming back.Even when Tanya as well these days she's still very depressed and that's hard to be around all the time.It just is a it's a hard thing.So, you know, I might say something like I don't want to live that way for the rest of my life.But I also recognize that I do have a tendency to despair about some situations and I'm trying to find a realistic balance between thisblack between the wingsthat was sort of the end of that little spot.Yeah, yeah.Sure, as long as depression drugs on four more years, it feels like more like it's a drain on me emotionally and TimeWise and there is there's not much else in a relationship for me besides that that's a particularly Bleak picture of it if not totally accurate, but it's like the most important feature of a relationship is not doing things together caring about each other taking care of each other in like normal way.It's serviced her depression or something.Yeah, yeah, I feel like she has worked hard in the last I don't know 8 months to make that less true, but something can be less true and still very true.So.One thing I haven't really said anything about anyone else but in the last week a number of people particularly her friends, but a number of people have started like been congratulatory and said things like I'm so happy for both of you think I got it while in general since I sort of appreciate the sentiment.I think I find it irritating because I don't feel like this is a thing we did.This is the thing that I did in spite of circumstances some of which were Tanya, so I mostly wanted to say that so now I have and that's better.Thank you.Absolutely ya know but I think we've talked about that sound before I felt trapped in a lot of ways and one of the things that I do when I feel trapped is I try to find a way to like get out of it.So one of the things back on out of this by finishing my dissertation, so I feel West Rockton on my boys are still paying me and I'm still doing like some revisions and writing up papers, but I'm not trapped in that relationship that's in this weird place where I'm halfway across the country by video conference when I'm biomechanics should be in a laboratory like so that's gone if that makes sense.And so that has dramatically Less in my feeling of being at least for now.Not tonight in ideal since I don't know what the ideal thing would be to do.But I also know that I want to eat and I would like to do by mechanics, I think so, I think that I will apply for a postdoc with a couple of people that seems like I'll be relatively happy to work with there are a few other people.I can apply for a postdoc with but I don't think I will.Yeah, yeah.Yeah mostly in the context of where who it would be.I think I told you that I fix that chapter of my dissertation that was falling apart.Did I mention that?Okay.So that's that parts now, perhaps my favorite section of the dissertation both because I fix it and because it's so my advisor Kevin really likes chemistry the change the way he thinks about the world and somewhere and so the answer to that puzzle which he had in front of him for five or six years now is relatively simple but it requires considering an element that normally we don't consider or piece that we normally don't consider and so there's a sense in which that has changed the way he thinks about the electron structure of these compounds and that's so it's nice because it's like one of my one of the things that I really hope that I could do is do chemistry that he would find like in that class of things that really change the way you think about something and so, you know, I guess I'm proud of having done that in so that changed my general feelings about getting it.I put me in a place where I feel less like put me in a place where I feel more like it would be a very reasonable choice for someone to hire me.So I feelTrapped in that regard also and that sort of unrelated to the question.You just asked kind of in the same thing.That is a fantastic question.I don't know how to answer it.I mean, I think it's really the right question in some way but I don't even know how to begin tackling it.My first response is to say well, why do I feel trapped because if I can identify that then in theory I could alleviate some of those things and I think we just talked about that in some sense.She's unhappy most of the time and notAnd I guess I feel like I don't really trust her to or the same extent at all.Like I just I meant to say more there but then.Seems like the appropriate place for it.Right, right.Yeah, so I feel trapped I think because I can't leave or I can't leave without breaking about which is the thing.I don't want to do and I can't make her better and it's I don't know.I'm not sure how to say it.Other than like it's emotionally draining to be in a relationship with someone who's like who's depressed.Yeah, I mean, I think those are related things.Yeah, I think it's not strictly fair to say I get little of what I need.I think maybe it's better to say I cannot predict when I will get anything that I need or when it will be like no having needs a totally unacceptable or intolerable or something.So that does one thing and then like feeling like it's a burden to ask for anything is another thing.Yeah, if I don't just as myself from her at least internally then yeah it is it is doesn't hack my mood for her mood to be low, but then if I distance from her internally, then we're just in some sense and that itself is like not necessarily what I want in a relationship and I'm not saying like I wanted was to be tightly coupled at all times but like is not a feature of relationships like shared experience or something like that.That was actually meant to be a question.Yeah.Yes or no, or that's not the right way to think about it or something.Right, but I feel like sometimes we want things in relationships that we should not want or that like that reflects a problem in itself.Yeah, I understand element of that.But that more rises from like not having a clear sense of what does a kid need or want or something like that?And I was like intrinsic question me or someone sort of like well, it seems like I can't have these things.Is it even okay to want them or something like that away in which is draining is I like to be around people who are excited about something, you know about particularly about what they're doing or what they're reading or thinking about or something.It's just butNot very often anymore.So she talking about wanting to be a priest and so she's a little bit excited about that and a little bit terrified about that and knows our I understand both of those and that's fine.I feel like wanting to be a priest is mostly a response to feeling like she can't be a cat.Academic academic session and feeling that's the closest thing given the type of schooling that she's done.Yeah, that's interesting.I certainly don't think of the session that way soyeah, I mean, I don't know whether it's related to Tanya or whether they're like both related to the same thing.I think it's more like that.Yeah, I guess you probably did mean that yeah, so that's kind of a big probably a d feature of highlight to existing relationships.I don't want the relationship to all be about me.And so it's we talked many times about this being a strange relationship for me because like I come and tell you my problems and that's what we talked about.So, yeah, I definitely feel like I also try to alter that narrative at least internally somewhat in order to feel better about it or something, but also in the real world like actually want to talk about things that are interesting to you.Maybe I want to be interesting to you wishes.I didn't have a follow-up that or I thought that there was more but that wasseems reasonableYeah.Most complicated.I assume you don't have anyone that comes in here and tries to alienate you like if they're so above they're going to throne on I don't know.fair enoughI mean, I guess I have had experience of people who seem like they're trying to alienate everyone around them.That's a mindset that I have a really hard time like grabbing.Well, so that yeah, that was mostly just saying like that seems like one lemon the end of it.I wouldn't expect anyone to come in and do that.Although obviously people do so, but insane obviously people do I think that are actually resolve some of what I was trying to resolve becausego ahead now, go ahead.Yeah, there is that like don't care about you as a person.I see.Yeah, that's not a given.Yeah, so that's one of those like really deep questions that I have a hard time grabbing because it's sort of like well, how is that even a question?Do you walk into a room expect everyone to be interested in you and what you have to say?Okay.rightYeah, so I'm not here next Wednesday.But the following Wednesday is January 1st.I will be here but I assume you are not working on January 1st.Okay.Okay, so I guess I could do any other time in that first week of January.I can't do next week.Well, I think we're getting back.What are Tuesday?That would be great.That's fine.Sure.That sounds great.Okay.Thank you.You too.Sorry.Alright, thank you.Excuse me.I had my nice yesterday.What's the school is over for the semester but I wanted longer it probably kind of feels like I miss that structure but I'm kind of a little sad about Peter Department.I went to see my roommate yesterday and she said she keeps they keep finding people but for some reason these people don't want my room.So I've already paid for the December rent without actually living there and I've paid for the January rent.Also, I feel really bad about this just working out $800 is $900 a month without like sort of just wasted.So I mean the reason why I wanted to leave the place, I mean we talked about all of the psychological subconscious reasons, but the Practical thing that I was thinking was there was already someone who was interested.So I kept thinking about her and thinking of saving that money or giving it to my momSo then when I finally decided to me.Place, I asked that girl and she was still interested.That's why I asked my roommate to see if they would be a good fit and they're not and I was like I was a little upset by that because Alana's like yeah, the girl is a little pushy and I'm thinking she can't be any pushier than me or when do you guys actually see each other?Not that often.It was kind of lonely in that place because I wouldn't see my roommates for days and there's such little interaction time.Why does it matter that the person you don't really see that often is pushy?I don't know.I cannot becauseI cannot do anything because they're the ones who have to live with the person.So I'm not allowed to do anything.I mean, I know I sign the lease I'm responsible for the rent and obviously I'll pay it but just makes me feel a little bad for so they're all the they reject to get a lot of interest but then they reject people and one of the guys they rejected because he was upset that they that people mispronounce his name.I don't know.Well yesterday.I was feeling really really horrible.I was walking around the streets crying just I just and I was actually aware of what I was doing.I was thinking of Andre thinking and rethinking the same things and I was feeling so victimized and like what we talked about having that narrative constantly debilitate me.And I kept thinking all the odds are against me and well in the morning, I was on Facebook and one of the people I met a while ago, she's an artist she has drawing and yesterday someone posted her interview in this National newspaper in India.And I I mean, I like that girl a lot but a part of me was when am I going to make a little something of myself that I'm proud of and she's created this bubble.This Enchanted world where she does her art, but I'm not sure there are other parts to it.I'm sure she's had to struggle and she's had to accept that.She's not going to have too much money, but I just feel when am I going to be able to make that happen every time I try for something else goes wrong or something else happens and makes me feel bad.I guess another way of looking at it is that I react to situations in a negative way.I don't know.I mean, what's the point of always be thinking about that person that had such a nice childhood and like and their parents are nice and they can go home and be with their parents and lean on them anytime they want to and I don't have that.I mean, okay, I don't have that much except that it's a given a move on.I mean, that's what David would like me to do.So but I don't know.Why do I keep doing that?I mean, I guess I look at other people to draw lessons from their life.How did they do it?How did they ignore all the crap and do what they want to do?I'm always looking for that.But I also end up looking at though they have this thing that I never had that cannot.I cannot do anything about soivyCompare ourselves to each other all the time, right or that's like some people like me who are insecure do that.I'll do it more often.I meanYeah, and I was asking him but I was like because he knew this girl too and I was like, so just to make this clear you have absolutely you feel absolutely nothing negative when I tell you about her entry.He's like yeah, I don't know Mike.Wow, I'm like totally insecure and you're like and I mean, he's like no I know what I have to get done and I'm like, how can you not feel like what you're doing might not be a significant or as popular as what she's doing and you don't think that way it's like well, I wish I could just be just a little bit like that would always be insecure or will I be able to feel a little secure myself?No right now, I'm not.Yeah, I guess I mean, I'm sure I I'm trying to think if there were times in my life where I was less insecure, but I don't know I might have been but I might have still been insecure about other things even as a child as like to stop going to Facebook.Stop looking at like deliberately torture yourself.Like I'll start Facebook in the morning so I can feel bad all day, but he's right about that then I'm like, but I have to develop those impulses and so I can be emotionally strong and look at those things objectively and he's like well until you do.You should I don't know.But I should say was changed or maybe it's I don't want to jinx it.But and I hope it's true there but I'm learning that thing about what I'm feeling is temporary.I don't know.I hope it's true because previously all these things I'm feeling I would feel them so intensely and I would just be totally in the moment and then it's Victor says that there were just be dishonest abundant present and no regard for there is a past or if they're well regard for the past definitely but no regard for the future, but I think my thinking is opening in that direction a little bit and I actually do you like or a sense that oh, I guess I'm sad right now and it feels awful, but maybe I won't feel so awful a few hours or a few days.I don't know.Is it it's a small I don't know.I want to be like it's there but I do I mean I was feeling I was very very sad yesterday.I mean, sad enough to cry and not even realizing that I'm out in public.But yeah today I wouldn't feel like crying and I don't know maybe I just don't know how to be secure just in myself.I feel like I need a set of legitimate treatments be able to build on my sense of being on that my sense of self.I mean if I did nothing at all.I don't know.I don't feel like I should deserve to feel the chair and just the knowledge that I am that I exist.I don't know.I want to play the blame game, but I'm like did this come from a did this sense of you have to do something you have to do something.Otherwise, it's awful.I wonder if this comes from David.Yeah yesterday I had this dream.And this is like I never dream about him.So it's very strange.But I had this dream that we were in the room in this place.It looks very normal, but it's a game where it's a horror movie free listings.Are they left on their own and there's a glass or something and I was behind when he was putting those things out because he knew how to do it or maybe a sense from us playing Angry Birds too much, but I don't know.Oh just stuff you with stuff and there's a glass or something horrible happens and I was on his arm and I was next to him and he was going ahead and defusing the stuff.We're doing it the right way because he knew how toyeah.I don't know.It was like furniture or something and suddenly it looks like Furniture but as soon as you go close or do something it changes it was deceptive stuff.It looks normal.But as soon as you did something that changed and became like yeah harmful something scary pop out or something, but there was that was just one of the dreams I have other dreams 2 and when she wasn't there.Oh, yeah.I was just I had the ability to fly.It was weird, but look like Google Maps.Do you do that?Sometimes?I just sometimes just caught myself down on some corner of the street and the images via where you can actually see the street level View and then you just go from one point to one point and then you're able to see the whole street like that.So it was like that.Yeah.I was just imagining I would say, okay.I'm going to go down the street and I would just fly over it.I don't know.I was in an auto just really famous actor in India.He doesn't look so good now he's in his forties, but I was with him and he was 18 and he looks really really cute and hot it's weird.And then I tried really really hard to imagine Victor straight, but I just couldn't do it for some reason then finally did it I cheated or something and I did it and that was hovering over him or something.That's it.It's so weird.I don't know.I was just like om flying.I don't know that I was serving stuff.I don't know.I can't describe it.I think it was sexual.It's very weird and rare for me to have that kind of dream.But yeah, he was holding me in his arms or something.Isn't that weird after I had that dream?I I don't know.I think I had that dream after the walking into the deceptive living room with David.I'm crazy.No, maybe not that.No, I mean, I'm sure you've heard crazier dreams in your profession.But no, I mean I need David through his guidance.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, and for the first time maybe letting him be letting him take care of me letting him leave me.I don't know what I feel about that because I thought I would want to do it myself take care of stuff myself, I think because I said it in this way before that.I feel like everyone is expecting me to be an adult and be independent and I feel that myself.So maybe I was resisting him being in charge and leaning on but I guess I'm accepting that I should lean on him more or I all ready and waiting on him.I don't know.I don't know why it was totally unexpected because I was just having a very innocent dream about flying.Yeah, I think I might have seen my mom.Also, she was teaching or something in the school and I just started flying from there.What do you mean?Ritz carry a bit weird but normal an exciting imaginative and also I guess a little yeah fun and dangerous and being Sly and because I kept telling myself course, I'm invisible.No one can see me soI don't know.It's like the Google Maps thing you feel it's yet.It was pretty close because of the ground buildings.I don't know but then hang with the actor I was visible.Yeah.I guess I felt just like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed you or I was doing something that people I don't know might find weird if they knew about it or not like it or something like that.But yeah, it was springing.I don't exactly know what it feels like to feel free.There's a lot of anxiety attached to freedom I think for me so because I'm doing something it feels like I'm doing it for the first time or I don't know what it's going to be.Yeah.What is free?What is it?What do you mean when you say feel free?I don't know.No, because I'm saying I'm telling that for me.It's something that's full of anxiety.So I'm not really sure that is freedom or if it's not.I guess they do but I'm saying for me they do I haven't asked other people if that's something to them, too.My obsession with him as David puts it.Yeah, this is so much crap attached to that whole thing.It's just so weird.Yeah, the best everyone is doing or just ignoring it and nothing can matter again.Yeah, I don't think about it.Now I was asking about like will we ever be okay with him or I don't know.I mean, he was a good friend and now he's not even that.Yeah, there's so much weirdness that episode I see him on Facebook or David says stalk him or I don't know any spending women and it's like I don't know.I'm just afraid I mean I wanted to give me that he's seeing other women, but I'm not sure if I am.Okay.I think I have it was hovering over his bed because he was sleeping and I just wanted to be like give him a hug and then just quickly fly away or something.It wasn't a sexual thing which is weird because it should be but it wasn't it was actually sexual with a third totally different unattainable guy.It's like unattainable in every single way.I mean you look that way in 86 or 90 or something.butNo, no, no.Oh, yeah, maybe you're right.Yeah.Yeah, well yeah, I'm not sure what time it was I just assumed that what that meant was like it stillBut this guy this actor still looks like what he did when I actually just have a crush on him as a 10 year old or something.I don't know.I don't know.I guess love makes you feel younger.Yeah.I don't know if I was younger.Maybe I was a little younger.I don't know.I never pay attention to my age in my dreams.I don't know if other people do but yeah, I come across I never thought about it, but I think I come across as a girl child not really a woman, but that's because I don't think of myself as a woman.I don't know when I will but I was stopping my arms and my arms look pretty thin.So I was like, yeah, this could be a younger me or yeah, maybe I feel like that because I just don't have friends were younger to me.So I don't feel older.I did a twenty-four-year-old a while ago.I didn't know he was going for I thought he was in his thirties.But as soon as he told me he was 20 or I just completely lost interest if I even had in the first place, but I didn't really feel old with him.We didn't really do anything sexual soYeah, it's just like I don't know with Victor.I just feel like there's so much the Press stuff now is just going to be surprised.I wanted to get to give him this book for his birthday, but I couldn't even bring myself to mailing it or telling him that I bought it.So.That's keeps telling me he treated you really really badly.And he even said yesterday.Are you going to ruin your career your dreams just because of him you're so you're obsessed with him, and I was like God, I hope not soJust not being able to work and I'm just constantly thinking about him and stuff.I guess I'm trying that's what I'm trying not to do.I don't but I do think about him but it's I don't try to con because then I'll just be like, oh has he replied or if I might want to see him then I'd be like, oh does he want to see me and when and in what condition and if I see him then I'll be like, oh are we going to get back together or not?And it's just going to be it's going to waste too much time.So weeks months.I don't really have that shouldn't do that right now to stage.I don't know.Well now that I'm describing the dream.I was struck by the hold deceptive aspect of the things they look normal and then that's how I feel like stuck.Process, you know, oh I can deal with the situation and but then explodes in my face or scares me.It was scarier than explosives.It was more like I don't know it might change into a ghost or Witcher something andYeah, and then I was like a damn.I don't know maybe in a haunted house or something or not really because everything was right and stuff, but then you go up close and then just kind of changed and I didn't know how to deal with it where David was dealing with them.So yeah, I mean in some ways I guess I felt like that maybe if I go to parties with him host by his friends or his faculty and just watching and waiting for a cue for him from where ya where in India is when he was doing his research.I was just following him and being with him made it easier or navigating form City even know how to navigate the city take an ottoman stuff even in my own University.I was with him and he and I were traveling together.So yeah, I mean in a place like idiots a bit risky for a single woman to go about on her own.I mean they do it all the time, but it just like I haven't been there in a long time so it for me it's a bit scary.So it's nice that he was there with me.Yeah, but how can I feel secure if I've had him it if I'm a sidekick?Well, it's funny isn't it funny is ironic because he's there to make you feel secure, but then I feel insecure because I'm not secure on myself.Batman or not?I'm robbing, but I'm not even like I don't even have half the powers that Robin might have I don't even know what powers does Robin have butt.Yeah, I guess because then I was flying on my own and I see what you mean about it being liberating.It was I mean it was all so it was a twinge of anxiety with it.Not that oh my God, I'm going to fall.I don't think I felt that but I just do I know what I'm doing that kind of thing.Yeah, I mean, it's just like what I said so often hear that okay.I have 45 minutes.What?I say how do I say it?Yeah, and yeah, it was in an urban space.I was I had my roots like I said on it was like Google Maps.It was really from point A to point B, actually remember thinking that okay from now.I'm going to fly from the street and straight to that to the end of buck Street, which is where Victor's house is or something like that is very structured and oriented.It was not open space and on top of an ocean or something.Yeah, I wish I knew how to feel more secure just by myself.It's okay.If David wants to help me in he wants to take care of me and I should let him but I should also know I can figure out that just have to furniture on my own.Okay, sounds good.Merry ChristmasU2Thank you.The last week this time, I think I was out of practice was part of it just like it has been a long time and I think we asked if I knew I was frustrated and I don't know what I said.If I answered that it's time that I had known that I was frustrated but not perhaps the extent to which I was not talking about being frustrated and that's hot difficulty talking about being frustrated with you.My friend Franko is applying for academic jobs right now, which is a stressful thing normally, but he's also the advice he got from his thesis committee was that he should just do another project real quick before he applied for jobs and use that as the top.So it gives him a month to do the work that normally would take a year or something which is terrible advice, but it's what he got.So I've been talking less about my frustrations with him so I can be available to him and not clearly not very good time in his life and not talking with Tony about it.There's kind of just a I think it did turn into a you know, it's like when I would come in here six months ago and I would be very angry or upset and not as aware of it or where the extent to which I was tamping it down keep going through.I think that's part of what was going on.It's a good thing that we had the sessions last week Tanya and I went to wedding of one of her cousins this weekend, which was a hard time for me.The wedding was beautiful and there were a lot of parties and that was all fine.Normal kind of annoyances that go along with going anywhere with her family.No one's ever on time for anything.We made it to the wedding on time by only by about 2 minutes and only because we tried to get there about 40 minutes early.So that was good.It's one of those things.I don't particularly care if we're always going to be late if we're not also trying to get there on time.So it's sort of like a I don't know the other failure to match one's own expectations is a particularly frustrating part for me anyways, so I just I started to say expectation that we've been an hour late and then it was so I can deal with that but that's that goes for talking about changing expectations in the face and not being able to trust that something will happen reset.The expectation is starting my response to it.You know, all the time is extended family.Wanted to know what a biomechanical engineer does.There was a nice guy Fisher out of frame it it's a reasonable question except for the panic and all of their eyes as they're asking question because I'm not going to understand what you're going to say Panic so I can't get a good response to that face with the these are minor things that just come with the territory there.Okay, we kind of got through them and move on it was the weekend was particularly hard, I guess in one General way and in one specific way the specific what way was that?It was very hard to stick to the same wedding ceremony the same letter G that I had gone through, you know, they say essentially the same.Was to each other and here I am sitting next to a person and having about sort of read to me as aPeople contract with the reality of my situation at present.These are the intentions or these are the promises and here's where we are.Doing the service they do this strange thing where they do exact location of intent and then they actually do the boughs and their separate parts of the ceremony presumably to ensure that the person get married isn't being forced to get married.That's why they have to declare their own in time.It's all historical kind of silly.And in that part.That's the part that contains the forsaking all others piece.So that's a little hard to hear.It's sort of like I was I guess I was in the process of dealing with that issue and then things got traumatically worse on the depression suicidality front.So it's hard to look back on my.And my marriage if any.Of my marriage say that was a really good time for longer than a few weeks.Pain in the actual Mouse portion.There's the in sickness and in health part, that's kind of a it sounds like a trap to me now.You know I made that I was fully aware Tanya's history of depression and amidst anxiety.That was her sort of default State during the wedding planning.But this where we are now is not really on the map when I did that so, you know, the whole thing kind of has a for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health sort of Duality contrasting to it.So it's hard to deal with when it feels vaguely like a bait and switch like yeah, there'll be both of these things.You'll have to deal with some bad things, but they're all be good things.Well, it's not been a whole lot of good things.So,I was thinking about the other difficult part of it, which was the family and Tire in the entire scope of the weekend.I didn't put on his father and her sister both come to visit us in Andover, but I haven't really seen or really spoken with either of them in five or six months.SoMaybe I miss estimating.So I guess Amanda was here in February.So that's been about 6 months.David was here maybe in March.So maybe April one of those two so four to six months.Yes, so it's been that long since they've been here.They've been in touch with Tanya talking to her which is good.But essentially not communicating with me at all, which I wouldn't say.I thought about a whole lot but I'm seeing them again.It's sort of like, yeah, I guess things have been hard here.And where have you all been and we're not going to even talk about it being having been hard or anything the entire time that we're here.I just, you know, there's a sort of mutual and knowledge meant that it has been a long time since you see each other and it's good to see you and I think that was real that's about it.SoAnd so I think I feel more alone in this and angry about that.Not that they're particularly people that I would rely on that.They were the were the people that were involved in this in at least vaguely in a crisis situation.So it'sI don't know.I don't know.So I guess we're some of us are leaving the reception the wedding reception at 2 in the morning.They're still whole lot of dancing and drinking and partying going on, but it's time for some of us myself included.But Amanda it's on your sister is still there.And so in that that was the only moment in which we had anything like a conversation about it, and in that moment.She wanted to tell me that I wanted to leave didn't really want to be having a conversation at that moment.This was like bye I'll see you tomorrow for the conversation on my part, but on her part, it was so glad to see you.I've been thinking about you everyday.I know we haven't talked, but I've been thinking about you.To which I sort of I said, well your life hasn't been exactly great either.She's been fired from her job for failure to be organized at all.Wish you responded.Yeah, but something to the extent that's not an excuse.So no, I don't think I'm not on their radar.I think that I think in her case, she feels like she ought to do something but isn't quite clear what it is and that has set up some sort of guilt cycle that prevents her from speaking to me except when she's really drunk.It's not like I'm thinking about the whole thing.If this were a weekend where they were all coming because no one's life is in a particularly wonderful place right now and everyone is like let's just leave everything behind have a really good time and focus on these people who are getting married I can get behind on something.A that's not why what they were doing because it's not like they're normally dealing with their issues.So it's not like leaving them behind as a change and be David's approach to the weekend was try to mend fences with all the siblings were not someone's always fighting with his siblings.There are like six of them, so too.so it'sso that no sense was at the approach.So it's I don't know.I guess I've lost the thread I can sort of rationalize what's going on, but I'm still upset about it.Which I find a little strange in that watching myself perspective because I don't really go there with any exception expectation of actually didn't go there with any expectations at all.So I in some part of me.It's like what are you upset about butt?Fair enough.Yeah.Sure seem to be yeah.I guess I'm sitting here trying to sort out like why why am I so unhappy and angry about this?And it seems like the more I try to recapture the sense of self the more I'm like what the hell was all of this and then you know, I think you've noticed that I value personal responsibility and we talked about to what extent is hog assault we're not on his fault.And so the farther we get from it, but I guess the more of a claim of lack of control or whatever seems like a convenient excuse or something.Yeah, yeah.I'm very curious about what you wonder I was just going to say it's alsoI mean, I can't really even talked about it with her because she doesn't remember it.So it's like how can I hold her accountable for something sheI'm in a position of power in a sense if I can say this happened or you were this way and how could she were but or comment so it's like I can't even I don't know address or something.No, she doesn't remember it it is it was erased from her memory by the ECT Sochi.So like the particularly bad.Of Our Lives she has essentially no.No memories from what were you wondering?I know that's right.I know that's right.That's right.It's sort of like through the land of illness I have.Yeah, and that is yeah.I know I think that's a really nice inside.I was not that.But it there might head wants two days ago and I haven't looked at it since anything that visiting her family and being frustrated by like everyone in her family, like extended family included being having a particular sense of ethic is or proselyte just romantically different from mine.Yeah.I think that's a large piece of them.Yeah, and I have no idea what to do about that.Yeah.I think that's right.Yeah, I guess I'm thinking about two things one.I'm not exactly sure how to have those conversations.It's kind of a practical issue that can be dealt with the other is that I think this is I think it helps explain why hey I have been not quite sure how to phrase it but less than perfectly pleased by her wanting to take on some of her responsibilities again, there's this element of not trusting that that's a good idea and it sends the shell overburden herself, but I think this is also like a I don't know a sense of assuming responsibilities when it's convenient as opposed to always or something and so it's now it's convenient again.So you want to take them back will great.That's not that's not how we do things.I think that's I think that's right.So in a practical sense, I'm not sure how to have the conversation because clearly I'm pretty frustrated or upset non one level.It's not particularly time to start into a conversation thatWe're at a whole lot of pent-up frustration and on the other hand.It's not particularly clear that she can handle a conversation where I'm very frustrated.I think she probably can butNot going to spiral the ends up in the very bad place again, you know when suicidality or self-injury are Hospital.Right, right.Yeah, I hear you when I think you're right.I just don't ya I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point.Sure.So what do people do?I'm thinking that in order to express it to her.I have to find the right level of not caring about the impact on her.I mean I cannot be worried about the impact and say something but in order not to be worried about the impact of has to at some point not care about what it does her because if I know it's going to happen and they do it.Anyway, then I've done this thing.No, I can't.No, but if I can reasonably project that it's going to do something bad.And I do it like I'm not going to throw a rock at your head because I can't know what's going to happen, but it's probably going to hurt.Yeah, that's definitely true.Yeah, I guess I'm still stuck on Canton.Oh, yeah, I definitely feel that my anger can be destructive.I guess I told you before that I have sometimes when I'm very angry.I want to smash everything.I don't that's a control thing.I don't do it not I don't want to do it.So yeah, I feel like I could easily be obstructed if I were to let it sit so that's certainly a component here or it feels like it but I am I guess I'm yeah, I guess I'm stuck on can't know it's not that I don't accept like yeah, obviously I can't know there's not a but it feel like you're making us stronger saying that like I cannot project with any reasonable certainty that like, yeah, it's not 50/50, but I can't tilt it much past 5545 or something.No, I you know, you're probably right I justCan't I don't know.It's a I mean, I know I think you're right.I do not have a particularly good sense of this moment of what she can and can't handle because at any given time I sense of what she can and can't handle seems like behind where she actually is.It was accurate two weeks ago or whatever, but it's not accurate for the day.Okay.Okay, thanks.Yeah, I'm not sure I can.Think about it.And I'll be in touch.Thanks.Thanks.I don't know where to begin.So probably best place is present moment, which is just trying to figure out where I'm at present moment wise, which is probably going to the course or the session where I'm at.This morning is Lieutenant Dane strapped to the mass of the boat raging Against The Storm.That's where I'm at.I mean, it's like there is nothing more Robin Lieutenant Dame Sans screaming at the storm.So yes, and I'm remembering a sentence from a few sessions back.How would I know you're angry?Well, I'm not sure that I'm in this place physically showing it but it's possible.Why don't you take me if you can can you take me back to where we lost our last session?Yes, okay.Yes, so that weekend that weekend.I went to see the kids so I had an opportunity to see my son Harry in.Monroe and he had a conference.I stayed over with him lovely lovely evening went out to dinner or went out to breakfast went to out to dinner when my daughter came over.So we had I had an opportunity to connect with all of the kids.It was just me because my wife at the conference with her friends and then we all we all converged at Indiana University Sunday afternoon.My son was in a show.I didn't know the show the show was A Little Night Music.Yes, me too.And I said there's a Stephens hold that I've never seen.So it's where the song send in the clowns comes from?Okay, and it's all about these love triangles of people in unhappy marriages and Mistress of Mistresses.And there's my son playing me on stage and I said, oh God, this is really the irony here is too thick for me to even sit in.yes, I don't know if there's much more to tell other than that but hearing send in the clowns will never sound the same again, so it's just likeYes, yes and then yes, so it's recognizing the lid it's just coming off with the pressure cooker other image that I have is I am I don't know it's terribly unpleasant but just vomiting up emotion and it's the best that I can be is restrained, but I recognize that I've been having these physical reactions.I can feel it.It's like being with the sensations of the body andJust a lot of tension.I recognize the closer I drive.To going home.It's just this build-up of tension.It's just such a yes.Virtual feeling.So give me a second to try and pull up together, but I'm trying to remember a series of events so thatSo that was the weekend.I think that I'm just going to throw stuff out there at this point.It feels like no Ruby movie reference, but just a visual of I got these puzzle pieces and I'm throwing them on the table.Like I don't know what so there's a sense of okay.It's not unreasonable to want to have a relationship emotional and physical intimacy.This is crazy.And there's just all this anger just kind of building up andOh my God decades and it's probably anger that.Create my marriage.I don't know and then yes, I don't know if I can really remember if there were other significant events of that week but the weekend for Christmas this year, we decide knots by guess we ended up buying a season subscription to Broadway on Detroit.So we got tickets and we end up going to the first one of those shows on Sunday night and we ended up going to dinner ahead of time and I was just in this place of kind of of now kind of of this but we're in this public place and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know that there's something wrong.So she's asking me what's going on and I say recognizing that I am trying to jump back into those old patterns of I'm not saying the words, but they're right there.There's nothing wrong.I'm fine, but I'm not going there.So I'm just sitting with it and there's maybe some awkward silence, but I was finally and again, I'm not going to be able to give the Serbian them or anything like that, but I was able in probably choppy senses and language able to get out expressing all this anger that I am feeling about.And again, I wish I had my recorder so I could have gone back and replayed.What was that we you were really able to say but I know that words probably like the bullet point that you could have used for the 6 News was I was able to say a third person relationship and I'm the odd man out.I did say seven or eight years ago.You called down the flag from the flagship and you transferred it to Lisa's house and you left me here with nothing.And so I know that was kind of like where I may or call other things that I was able to stay but for me it was like, okay and the point that I'm trying to I was saying it but there was I don't know remember the sense of being out of control.It was more a sense of there was almost just calm determination.I'm saying this I just kind of learned leaned into it a little bit and it was okay.And as a matter of fact it was like wow.You know the anticipation of saying that was far worse than saying it.Wooden table mean I think just the work that we've been doing questioning the canoe sitting with this.I think coming to some kind of resolve but I don't know when that happened but I got to this point and I remember saying it out loud.Damn it.I'm going to have to get intimacy back into my life.And this is not an unreasonable thing for me to want.So I got to do something.I got to take some action to make this happen.I'm recognizing not sitting on my emotions and being dishonest with myself is not going to get me there.I think initially there was a sense of being there was some talk about kind of where this is coming from but it's kind of like the process I'm talking about that's true work.I'm doing within individual counseling and stuff like that.There was the sense of like, oh really?So happy for you and you're doing this and it will be not those were the words but the essence was it will be so great when you finally get all fixed and come back and everything will be hunky-dory and it was just that that was like throwing gasoline on the fire and I said,Oh my God.Right and it's just I recognize just that kind of inflamed the torch where the fire and then I also recognized that the other kicker in that was that whenever we talk about intimacy.Yes, it's like we're not talking the same language and she says she's starting to get a little defensive and then the tears are welling up and that kind of thing and she says.All of the things that I do for you to show you how much I care my love and affection for you and all the intimacy that I give you your just not there for that.I said well tell me what that looks like because I believe that's what you're going you're trying to do but I don't know what looks like that and she says well I give you a kiss in the morning on my way out the door when I tell you I love you and it just came out of my mouth and I said, yes, but you know what that looks like to me.It's just a reminder of all the things that I don't have in my life.It's just like well, this was probably not the most sensitive thing to stay in the moment, but it wasI got a pack on the head and that's it.Yes, and then it was kind of I recognize that.I recognize that was as far as she could go with that moment and she kind of went into this place of and it was almost time for us to move to the show, but then it became mine was conversation about this and that and she was fiddling on the phone and looking at Facebook and telling me about this not I was just like before though I was saying that we were talking about physical intimacy so that conversation then spilled into whatever we were talking about about intimacy is automatic.It's about sexual intimacy.And you said you're not hearing me you're not hearing me and I get it I get her fear of sexual intimacy is so deep that that but she started talking about our sexual intimacy in terms of past tense is incompletely past tense.We had a really wonderful sexual intimacy in our life.We have three wonderful kids, not necessarily.She said these words, but it'sThat's over now and I can't go there anymore.And it's kind of like it's sort of happened at the moment.But the stone that kind of got pushed over there.It took a while before that all started to roll into a Avalanche and it's like wow.Okay, that's been my experience for the last 7 years, but that's never been stated that's never been stated like yeah, it's completely over.I have this image that I'm the guy that's been sitting at the rear well station for the last 7 years waiting for the train to show up and I said dude, what a dumbass this train is not even coming back and you're still sitting at the chain at the station.Yes, I get that.But I mean that's where the anger is at in this morning.It was I don't know.Well, I'm trying to decide if that's the chain of events.So I get this back that all of this emotion is out there and I know it's not it's got to be scary the living Jesus out of her because I'm programs and it's in a pretty big way and I recognize that may not have been my intent but I don't want to hit the plunger but there you go.I put the nuclear option on the table.And again, where did this conversation fit into it?I'm not 100% sure but I was able to say, you know what I need physical and emotional Intimacy in my life, and I'm no longer willing to live without it.And that was a conversation that happened around the kitchen table, maybe yesterday or the day before I'm not sure.I don't know it all started to and I recognized it this emotional Rage or whatever that I'm in right now and I just started puking up junk and I'm sorry.Yes, I know.Well, I can't I can't and it's coming out and I get that is painful for me and her and everybody else.It's just likeI'm done at some point.I don't know why but it is just and I have kind of Shut Out music a lot in my life over the past seven years, and I don't know why.Well, I shut down everything.Okay, you know what?Okay.The music of course touches emotional cores.So why the hell put yourself there?Whether it's classical music or country music or whatever.I fired up an old Johnny Cash the last Johnny Cash album.He did a cover of Tom Petty.I don't I won't back down and I just like playing that and then it bumps up against his cover of Nine Inch Nails Hurt witches is just so incredibly raw that I'm like, okay.I'm not sure if I can even go here today.Oh, yes, and again whether this is all out and doesn't matter.I mean, it's how memory works this is why you can ask me 9 different people would happen up a seen the incident and they're going to get nine different explanation.But at some point something well, you know what you're asking me you're asking me to choose go to someplace where I can't go or you're leaving and I didn't all I said where those words and that was her interpretation of that.You know, I think that was the really amazing part of all of this.All I can feel is anger not feeling the guilt.Yes, I get that you're hurting and I know that would have done to me in the past and I'm not backing down and I know that there's going to be an onslaught.I mean, this is a fucking fire swamp.I mean this is just going to be this is going to be and I get it.This is, this is the path that you set up a long time ago intentionally or unintentionally.It doesn't make a difference.It's all the damn Domino's that you set up.You can't talk about your feelings.You can't do this.It's 27 years of this.So here's what happened.Here's what happened after 27 years of setting up those Domino's.Oh, I know but I'm going to take responsibility for me.I'm not good at being honest with me.I think I've been doing it for a long time.But I don't guess you know what?I don't think that's there.Yes, and if anything, the only thing that I can hold onto right now is that I can say that to me I can say that to me.It's okay say another event had happen is Insurance some of this with a friend there was this image that came back to me in some work that I had done a long time ago in the terms of like the inner child kind of thing.And this is back when I was doing my masters in religious education.I did a pro golf thing journaling class.So you're doing this imagery stuff and you're going back and revisiting past hurts and that kind of thing.But this in this friend had talked about about the stream Where She rescued this child from the real City hotel.There was this child in there someplace and she went in andDid this child?It seems like a really powerful image to me.I just kind of sat and with that for a while.I kind of Envision the CD hotel and I'm walking down the hallway and at the end of this hallway open the door in front of me my childhood home.I find myself the five-year-old self who's hiding in the bushes.And I remember the scene but the hiding from a couple of neighborhood boys who were laughing at me at the time.I don't remember why but that was what was going on and I had this Vision or have work with this image before and it was like always liked you go and talk to the child and tell her child.It's okay what ever it was blah blah blah blah and this time there is no talking.I was just grabbing up this five-year-old image of myself.And it has been hugely powerful thing because he had hasn't left me.Images just this deep sense of giving myself some love just like cradling those parts of me.The sense of all those years of.Be able to do that all those years of this foolish child who just had been alone and hurt or whatever that is.Yes and can't speak and interesting enough.There's this mask.I'm wearing The Lone Ranger mask and a little cowboy hat.Yes, this fight world and I got rid of all that stuff.You don't even need to have this on.Yes, so I do meditation in the morning and I got this meditation bench.So thethe pastor that I have is you kneeling on the floor in this bench and this 5 year old is just right from me and it's just it's really powerful imagery right now and it's that's reallyYes, and I really do feel like there's a sense of commitment to that.There's a sense of power to that.There's a sense of I know there's been no way that I can go back to whatever that was.So that's what a powerful game-changer for me sitting on Matt and Claire Carson's Workshop.It was good.The thing that I brought out of that was working with man is working with a deep sense of Shame some of the pieces started to fall together there.My issue with having this mild deformity in my penis or my penis is this huge shame that has been the major defining defended kind of thing that's going out of my life and recognizing the power of that shame my God.Yes, so I'm really trying to be patient with myself because yes.Well, I'm not running away from it and I'm not backing down from it.I got this really hugely Watershed stuff, and it'sYes, it's already both and I just don't know what the new beginning is, but whether whatever was ending a long time ago and it's just recognition, but that was over now.Whatever comes out of what I don't know at this point.I still washed out to the mass and I'm screaming there ain't no love and there ain't no compassion and until that Tempest that dies down.There's going to be no reasoning with this right now.No, I was just going to say yes, it was yesterday because we had the snow yesterday that I was in this place and she was home from school.I was trying to get some work done and then it was so we had this conversation talking about trying to go down that road of talking about intimacy and recognizing that were talking to complete different languages and I recognized in just sitting there trying to knock it into counselor mode, but really just trying to deeply listen to what you were saying.I feel and hear that she was so completely petrified of moving down the road ofYes, that's there's just and she's just screaming against it and yelling at me.oh, yes, I can't go there and if I had some kind of thing that like if I was in a car accident and I wasquadrilingual and you would stop loving me then to and I get you know, I get this is a very real thing for her and she says fine if intimacy is if that's so important to you then just go find somebody and have yourself a good lay and then so she's just yelling.Yes, I don't know and be happy or something.She can understand she can't hear what I'm saying.You would think so it would be.Well not according to her.her research, howeverrightYou know, I think again it was just pouring more gasoline on the Fire.She can't hear that.She's never been able to hear that and I get that now I get that probably all the way to the beginning of a relationship relationship, but that's not the way the relationship started which is still completely confusing because she was the one that initiated everything in the beginning and IYes, and so that was so all the sudden we got this completely upside down relationship.Oh, that was huge.Well, it confirmed my worst fears that I wasn't lovable.Of course and even though that wasn't what she was saying all of that aside deep down inside the story that I was really listening to that and that happened prior to seven years ago that happened.Yes.Oh, I know.Well, tell me what you're hearing.Yes, it's insane.And that's what I did for a long time.Yes, I can see if I'm only if my only expression of sex was.sado-masochismIt's not a surprise.Maybe not.I mean this is always been an issue and she's always it's always been this kind of thing.Like you can just love me for who I am.You got to have to have sex.all three timessame story same story.I'm not sure what point the honeymoon ended.It didn't last long and I'm sure after the kids kind of like the sense of okay, I got three kids were done.Yes, I don't know and I don't know if it's difficult to go back, but it's been a very long time.Can't you just love me for who I am?But that's the but that's the relationship in overtime overtime and eventually got to the place where we couldn't have sex at home anymore.So sex was relegated to maybe it free or four times a year by going away for the weekend.I was pretty much always initiate by me and we got to the point that the only way you're going to have sex as if you had two or four drinks beforehand.So you had to get in the self-medicating state before you go there.4 functionally probably not satisfying whatever.Yes, you kind of just recognize this and it's just ugly ugly to call out of the garage out.But yes, I think that I got to the point thatWell, I think yes, I think between Matt and for at least 10 years she had these premenopause migraine.So I mean if it's not a headache or working or the kids or whatever, there is no time when it's like wow, there's just no time.There's no time and thenOh, yes.I know that.Because there's nothing wrong with her.Right in this and the conversation always gets derailed around this we end up talking about this and it's like okay.We're missing the point missing the point completely.You got some serious hurts and you're going to need to get them fixed and there's no hope for intimacy until you can fix that and I don't know.Intimacy is the ability to completely learn about the other person and right now I know that I can't go there.I've never been able to go there with her because there's such a huge part of her life that I recognize that I can't bring my word ability to because that's like, okay.Well, I'm going to be completely open and burn a bowl with you, but you don't have to beNo, no, and it's like screw it.I'm getting I'm putting my intimacy into my life.You know what to ascertain agree.I feel like I made this commitment to myself whatever a week ago 2 weeks ago and I said, you know, I already have friends.I already have friends.I have friends that care about me and I recognize some things about me who the hell says.I can't have relationships friendships.Can I just explore that?I know she did and I'm not ready to go there.It made me feel really cheap.It made me feel really angry like God.I didn't accept it.I mean I feel that and at the time I was in this place of listening to it, but I wasn't in a place of reacting.I went quickly to this place of you know what I can sit here and listen and I can just be in the moment and listen and that's all I can handle and I'm not feeling like not that I am having down my emotions, but I feel like at point.I'm just giving her the gift and allowing her to get it out.Well this morning and I recognize that for I don't know how many years I showed up Faithfully to Wednesday night choir practice and she goes out with the girls every once in a while.I go home after choir practice I go home and whatever watch a series.I've been watching on Netflix or whatever so last night.It was screw this I'm not going home anymore.I'm tired of sitting in front of the God damn television and wasting my life.So I asked him the guys.I don't want to go to the bar.But how about Starbucks?Do you want to grab a Starbucks?I did.It was okay.I recognize I started listening to Graham Brown.Are you familiar with that name?in type Brianna Brown, it's in that spelled b r e n e Brown and she got some TED talks on shame and vulnerability and they're hitting me in a hard place, you know, right kind of stuff and one of the things there was a little 5 minutes segments and you get toYou get to the Ted Talk and there's a little five minutes segment where she's talking with Oprah, you know, it was just like a little segment of 6 people.You shouldn't share your inability with people who don't deserve your credibility and I recognized in the mist of this last night going out with this guy was likewe're not going there.And that's okay.I did it I said okay.I got to go now.Oh that's coming instead of going out with the girls last night.She went home, but she didn't tell me she was going home.So I get this text.I'm almost home.I get this text.So are you?Okay?Where are you?I came home after choir practice and you weren't here and I just I could have just started to feel it bubbling up.Rage anger and I said this all about clean now.This is all about recognizing that I put the goddamn nuclear option on the table.And now after 7 years are finally going to pay some attention to me.It's just it's justAnd then I have ever seen in the morning.I have a routine in the morning for years and this has been spoken about its known I wake up very slowly in the mornings.I have and half hour to 45 minutes meditation routine exercise.I have to go walk the dog and I move I get up very early in the morning because that's my time.She got up this morning at 5:30 and she's out there making breakfast andAnd I'm getting up and I went out and I walk the dog.We normally walk for five minutes, but I just walked and I was so in touch with one of the other episodes where I was where I was that angry and I just ended up walking down the country road for about 3 miles and I wasn't coming back.It was just like I'm and I'm stillit's just too little too late.Exactly.So theninteresting those words to me.So what I feel is I'm putting all this intimacy out here and you're just pushing me away, and I said I can't just turn it on like a spigot.She doesn't get it.I was sitting there and I'm physically felt like I was going to vomit and I was shaking I could barely talk.I was able to tell her that I'm feeling such anger and rage right now that I can't even function.And at that point I just got up.I just whatever I was doing.I was getting I recognized I didn't shave I barely remember to get my books.I said, oh man.I'm such a place here this morning.I can barely payment.It's all fucking around and I said yes sitting around in choir practice last night.I said, I'm so fucking tired of this.I'm living this lie.I'm done.I'm done with this shit.Done with so I recognize that this is a huge it's going to be we're not talking like I don't know.Well, I have one friend and I think at this point, unfortunately, I don't know.I don't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate, but we're both really kind of in the same boat right now.But I think we both recognize how needy we are how what the needs are for boundaries in this.So I think we're trying to really work on that but I feel so out of control.And I'm just I don't want to hurt anybody else.You know, I do have a connection with some people and I feel like I've got people I've got a network of people here.Thank God.I've got a network of people here in a little bit here in a little bit there.Yes, and I recognize that there's some professional boundary things that I've got to be really concerned about in that kind of thing.Yes, I know and I know and I guess it's just the the way I don't know.I suppose if I sat and reflected on it, I suppose that that's kind of the way I do things.Like planning and planning to build a house in finally.Boom.We're going to make it happen planning and planning to start your own business and it's like, okay.This is it.So I suppose that that's the way I do things.I don't know.Thank you.Yes.No, it's yes.It's pretty in from earlier place.No, it's just looking at yes looking at the consequences of everything.Oh, yes, that was definitely set.No, I'm not stuck.yes, it's just that I've put in motion of getting some names of a couple counselors, butI'll take suggestions, but I remember talking to someone who's this couples counselor.She said yes, I work with a couple it's just that I asked them up front.Are you with me on this and all the times?I get a lot of resistance you least give me 25% you're in on this and I got nothing.I'm bringing nothing to the table and I'll give you what I I will go but there's just absolutely nothing but today anger and rage.I I've got no compassion today.I can do that.Even though I'm getting the message of you being incredibly selfish.It does sound pretty ridiculous just to be saying that in this room, doesn't it?It sounds ridiculous that I would be thinking that and that would be acceptable.I will.Right not next week.Yes, and she has a 3-day thing.She's going up with the band at the beginning part of next week.So.I'll get a little bit of a respite.I don't want to get watch that in the in the first place.Yes, and now I'm feeling like what I'm going to be dealing with is this clingy Behavior, which is all I'm going to be likeinflaming thingsYes, I suppose I can.Astro I'm going to stay with thatI will I can.And thank you.I think of myself asYou seen The Lego Movie?I don't know.I'm identifying with this little character.Who's the main character in the movie?Thank you.Good morning.So I'm not sure where to start again.We left off last time, you know being in the middle of things I guess but not really like it's sort of like we talked and talked and then we get to really hard things men fashion eventually wives down or ends, but I don't know how to pick right back up to where we were.I don't know maybe some of both I think mostly I think I at least try to talk about anything except Tanya and eventually we get talking about Tanya and that's just hard at least that's what I feel like today.I don't really know.I think it's sort of a lot of times.I find smaller problems generalized in a way.Like if we can solve something less important maybe that will speak to something more important and it will be easier to do so.I think it's something more like that, but I'm not sure.You know, it's like we talked about this brown students and taxes and means nothing important at all.But there's something about relating to other people that involved in it.So Tanya, I might just go going to Jumping to talking about Tanya then I guess so she continues to do well in the scale of the last several months.I think so mean and she's depressed but not near suicidal.That's that's good.I can't remember last week if she had surged trying to reconstruct the last several months of her life or not.She doesn't really remember them.So it's particular when she was doing ECT, but even reaching out much farther back than that.She said she can't really remember what it's like a brown or why she couldn't handle it or what was going on.That made it so hard.Which you know, it's like the last two and a half years.And so I find myself in this position of a certainty for the last several months.I've actually been here.I know exactly what it's been going on as much as I can see her from the outside before that.I have a general sense of what was going on.I was in there every day and I don't know how fundamentally I don't know why she could handle what was going on at Brown.I can tell through sort of the thing.She talks about what those are mostly useful as ways of reminding people that say it said before not as good descriptors of what went on but she can't remember what she said before.What she felt before so that's not useful.She got all of these journals because particularly when she gets depressed or when she was hospitalized.She writes the journal a whole lot.She has this view of she at least over the last several years that had this point of view of depression as being sort of the month Felix thing that was imposed upon her as if no external causes in her situation can possibly be related to it.So we're making it not very helpful because we talked about how she feels and not what's going on that is most certainly related to how she feels up a time but now we drifted away into the causes of Tony has depression, which is big in a sense fundamentally unanswerable question.Like why is she depressed?Maybe it's not I mean, I guess I would like to have feedback on that.You think it's on answerable?Know what that's okay.To what type of answer is it answerable?You can sort of get to this how it have.But it's very much one of constructing some sort of reality in which there's answers to that sort of question.No, I don't know that's sort of what I meant by fundamentally and then answer that I think like it happened.We can be pretty sure of that.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, and I can make sense of and I can make sense of it.Well enough and on the other hand, I can't make sense of it at all, I guess.Yeah, it's sort of like our best scientific evidence suggests that the biology and the environment are entangled and Subway like their environment Iran continues to shape you throughout the time in the actual physical way in recent studies that strongly support that it's good.It's interesting, but it doesn't we could talk about Mind Body divide and all that but I don't know that matter.Is it also when she had a particular set of suspect abilities that the environment at Brown really played on it despite counseling with an absurd number of people regularly and couldn't deal with it and couldn't deal with it and couldn't develop a way of dealing with it.When I guess the piece that I really can't get a grip on is where it came to suicidally because there's this option of just walking away from where she is but I think that for her she couldn't see it.Option I think that in part because she couldn't see the depression as a thing X parade by her surroundings or something like that.And so I can't make sense of it, but theis Halloween some way because sort of just rationalizing all the pieces not one that I can share with her in any meaningful way because she doesn't remember and soYou know, there's an interesting description of it as an illness itself has progressed across Generations in her family.So go her parents parents were really terrible parents just didn't seem to like children were angry all the time towards the children at their existence or something like that which left their father with anger issues in the mother with abandonment issues and then they got married and their anger and abandonment issues together and so her mother left and her father yelled a lot and then left her with both sets of issues, which they have played out in a relationship probating the traumas that were handed to her to me.I'm thinking I'm her I'm angry about it and she's coming back to the abyss in a lot of ways and she doesn't remember things being and she can just tell that she was in it because she's coming back from it.And there's sense in which she expects me to be a partner to her.I don't really trust her and you know, I think I love her but often I just feel so many negative emotions like pain and anger.Thanks, but I don't think about I don't I don't know what to do about it.So, you know you suggest about talking about it can help and I'm talking about it.But other than that, I don't really know what to do.Okay.Yeah, I feel like you got a pretty good handle on them.And there's a sense in which I think that's particularly hard to deal with for me because it falls into a repeated class of failures for me.So like I grew up in a religious organization that had totally corrupt leadership.I had these expectations of going to college and it being the filling time of you know, reading and learning and growing with a community of people want to do the same which I did find a very small community of people who are very like-minded, but it was not very not thatFull Celine undergraduate school for not similar reasons, but actually with similar expectations and really not the same.It's just an Ohio in a particular.Everyone is very very busy and doesn't recognize to extent to which they're missing and the real Conjuring ality in the department.It's really hard to see it be part of it and deal with again.I have these expectations of marriage of some sort of partnership that we had made a sort of plan together to do this graduate school sayings get through it together.She had just gone gone.It feels like this thing happened in some way, you know a place that willBut I won't snuff surprised and it happened in graduate school.I sort of went well.Okay, what do we do about it?And so I stopped on a lot of communities in an effort to make it a better place for the next set of people because it's not a thing that's going away.I don't know what to do here.You know, I'm doing well or very nearly all the house chores for two people for 6 months or longer in addition to working and trying to take care of Tanya manager care what other people are taking care of her and you know, she's now in this place of can't remembering things because of the e c t that she did and innocence on my watch right?So it's which can't remember things and I feel like at least a little bit of it my fault even though I'm not sure if I could have made any different decisions.So now I'm talking faster than you can respond or something butOkay.Okay, I think response would be helpful.Even if you aren't itching to.Yeah, and I can say these things to myself right just saying them.It's not often but enough if I can just acknowledge that but I'm not sure that's enough here.I know what has happened.I don't know what to do.Yeah, I don't feel like her feeling in her promises.Give me an excuse to fail in mine.It's that certainty in regular and regular contracts off.Obviously that voids the contract but it's not how I view this particular engagement for marriage literally but Arrangements.You know, then there's the question of does this matter what you know, if she's not responsible responsible for the illness can be angry with her and some sense.That is the thing that happened to her as much as it happened to me.But if she's responsible for the illness, then it's a thing she did as well as what happened to her.I don't know why it really matters, but it seems toYeah, I think that's about right.yeah, I know IrightSure.Sure seems to matter to me.Yeah, it's her.She does not like the idea of having hurt me.But mostly I think she's just pleased that she didn't kill herself, which is fair.I'm glad she didn't kill herself also, butYeah.Yeah, I know.I mean on one hand.It's a level bar on the other hand is a really high bar.You know, I think it really does matter that she didn't kill herself.I also think it's also matters that you didn't try although.When you get to the point of making a plan and getting ready to execute the line between that and trying doesn't seem like a large lines me, but not that big of a deal.I think she's heard those words and understood them, but I think I'm but I'm not sure.I'm pretty sure she would not have any idea.How the process would go?Yeah.That's okay.Yeah, I guess I don't have as you know, I don't have a very clear sense of How It Go but yeah.Yeah, I don't have a clear sense of how it go.But I and I don't have a clear sense of how we go in the same time when she was filled Crest like let's be clear.I don't think she's I don't know even that word to be used normal.I'm not sure I think she's still depressed but not nearly as bad and then so then yeah, I don't know that she's thinking very hard about the future so much as dealing with the present and the guy got to be awful not to remember the last several years that's got to be terrible, but I don't actually have as much sympathy left for her, which is horrible or I think it's horrible, butYeah, sure.I mean, that's right.I shouldn't have any more minutes.I said that jokingly butYeah, and so, you know, I think I'm better than other people.Maybe I have an articulated that in so many words before but I feel like I've tried to say that and so I have pretty high expectations for myself to be able to handle these things.And for the most part I can't so that any space between handling it perfectly and where I can actually am is not always but sometimes that's space in which I'm failing because I can see how you would handle it better, but I can't it's not some significant sufficient to say well under these circumstances a person normally handles it this way because it's very few aspects among the life and which I have been normal, you know, sometimes I can deal with that.Sometimes I can't that's an ongoing struggle to say.Under ideal conditions.I would handle it this way.These are not ideal conditions.Yeah, I feel like a way forward for us is for her not to reply to me alone right now.Like she has friends and family and then get them to help her deal with the problems of now are less severe and that we can help with and that's you know, I've asked her to talk to her friends and her family about the memory loss and she's both because she has a tendency to try and hide things like this and because I can't reconstruct every conversation.She had with another person for her or what she did with these peoples often.I only hear what Tanya told me and don't remember it now or remember it just be receipt house because it's justWhat's so I think she will do that.Justyou know, she seems to think that made sense and that she would do that in so I think she will I think it will take her time.I think she will continue to rely on me foryou know day today sport in a variety of ways.I don't know.yeah, and I can't remember now what I actually said, which would you know whether I said I think you need to orI need you to I can't remember which I said at the time.I mean the other piece other piece of this is like how do I have conversations with her where I say that like I can't support you right now.I can't do that.I hope heart is like both practically and murali like that is the thing that will hurt her.It's not like I haven't had pieces of that conversation over the last several months a couple months.If I know that an action I take is going to hurt her and I take that action then there's some sense of me trying to deliberately hurt her.Yeah, I mean, this is for the responsibilities question comes in.In though, doesn't it if we fight I don't feel like she did that to hurt me but I feel like she could reasonably understood both given her childhood and her first long-term relationship, but she had an emotionally abusive boyfriend who was depressing friend to kill himself if she didn't do whatever.I mean something like horrible horrific terrible things have happened to her and I get that and that's a bad but that should make him work through to her that doing these things is not okay not and so should make it more clear to me that doing these things is not okay not less.So it's like, you knowYeah, that's probably correct.No, it's interesting that that keeps coming to mind.Like I thought I had more or less put that to rest but other infidelity, but it's interesting that comes to mind when I'm angry now, even though I even though I really at least don't think or do you think I forgave her?Had words to heal.Mostly.I think that the analogy is good and interesting one.Yeah, I know.I mean it seems like there's some definitional expectations or something.Yeah.Clearly yeah.I'm thinking that's an interesting suggestion.I think it makes sense.You know, it gives me a window into why are you would do what you do also, and I think it's interesting.Well, if you think that it's almost impossible for couples to heal from you, then that somebody needs to do it.There's a good reason to do it.Sure.Sure, it's the same question of responsibility and I'm player.Yes, I guess there is often.Yeah, that sounds like more or less right?Yeah.Yeah, and then they're just like, you know in a sense of likehow it's good thing to be nice to people and that it's particularly a good thing to be nice to people who are in pain.So if Tanya is still in a lot of pain I should be nicer but I'm also angry it's hard being nice when I'm angry.That's true to ya.Well, and so this is when things right like this is why the brown students and their taxes are so relevant like they're not meeting their obligations, but it doesn't change what I need to do.So obviously I don't love them.So that's the issue.But I feel like you're arguing for some sort of society in my perceptions and I justOkay.I see I see.Okay.All right.Good morning.So I can't remember it was last time we met that you gave me two pieces of advice.I don't remember if it was a vice over two sessions, but you the first one was you suggested that I was going to be?Okay in one of two ways that is very helpful.And the other was that you suggested that you thought it would be that you would wish for me that I not that I accept things as not ideal, but also good or evil to do that in general.So I've been.Trying toBoth on certainly the first kind of ring true II also Rings true for a lot of reasons in a lot of situations.I got somewhere by so many pieces of Weiser last I guess lost ball sort of said we should just write up what you haven't talked in.It won't be the pieces that I always really wanted, but it will be good enough.So it's the specific version of the same advice.I think but not ideal but it's still soBoth pieces of been very helpful since then.I think I told you good luck when you said you wanted me to change the way I was approaching the world, but I've been trying just that was the recognition that would be difficult thing.So the first piece that was always helpful particularly in dealing with the violation of tonya's mood so not to use the word scientific but was Common Sense there's a lot of fluctuations in her mood on a short timescale and he suggested months ago that I not track her mood day today, but there's a glitch that's fundamentally impossible when I'm there and not paying attention to how her mood is at any given moment.But having in some sense of a clearer sense of there's a future that will end up.Make something unimportant.Or not it makes it only importantly an immediate context.So it's easier to deal with her or something.Yes, that is so it's yeah, I mean, I'm not going to be able to not pay attention to it, but it's just isn't really feasible.I guess you're saying that not what you're suggesting anyway, but I don't think I've ever really took you to be saying that just so much as not projecting a trend off of it at any given moment.So the second piece has been very pain helpful.No idea but still good still okay has been helpful in dealing with the variety of situations as I guess you might imagine it would be which is why you suggested it.So I'm working to apply for a postdoc position now and I was at the time finishing up a poster and taking it to a conference and spending time at the conference helicopter in relationship with conferences and other academic things in that I hold them to that ideal but they're never ideal.That's the but never going to be that's okay.They're still good.Although parts of them are not good and it'sso it'sso I give the poster on two different nights.I gave them a Monday and Wednesday night.The Monday night was supposed to be like a big Gathering of all the different areas that make up society and it's supposed to be some sort of privilege to present there, but it turnsBut no one actually cares what you've done at the session because no one has the expertise or background of knowledge.So they looks at what you say.Oh, no, that's nice, and then they kind of move on so it's not ideal and if it's good, it's barely good.Wednesday night 1Wednesday night was very different.I had to talk with variety of experts in the sub areas of my area of biomechanics about the things that I had done.That was fun interesting debt for everyone.So maybe it was an ideal either but it was still very good.So it's kind of I don't know I pressed you a little bit when you first talked about it.About well, so you want me to get rid of this idea, but not ideal equals not good.But I'm trying to argue also for the category that it's not good between those two something like that.So anyway,so I think it's been hold hold both to appreciate what I'm doing two and two separate.What is good from what is not good in actual sense as opposed to like cuz easy thing to say is that Monday night post session was an idea but it also wasn't but it was just a crappy post-recession, but that's okay because that's two hours of my life.Not a big deal.I don't really take you to me, but I think you're pushing pretty hard knot on the not ideal part.Not ideal does not equal good not good in part because you sense resistance.It's also been helpful and actually getting the work done to send out these applications because they're not going to be ideal either, but I can still write a good application and its again this morning to not elaborate categories.Because I could write an application.That would not yet read but I could write an application.That would probably be red and we'll be as good as I can do.And like I said, just as good as I can do, so, it should be enough.I can't really do more by definition.So, thank you.That's not saying it's like trivial in that all of my problems are solved by this one in sight, but it's very helpful.I'm trying to use it.The news are still somewhat fragile in that shoot.She has good moods now, which is good and has good days, but relatively small setbacks.I can't think of an example off hand what can be a larger impact on her than they would if she were healthier whatever exactly that word means and then they had at previous times that our life.She's been getting more involved in her church, which is good spending time around people like being involved in the community.I think it's a really good other side just barely drained from thenot really related to violating that sense that it's like everything's harder for you her then.It would be under arbitrary Harrison circumstances that wasn't 6 months ago.SoSo we've been spending making dinner.So the nights that she's working I make dinner and the other night.She makes dinner the process of figuring out what to make for dinner seems to overwhelm her some days not Ashley doing it, but like having to make a decision about where we would eat so I'm not really sure if I answered the question.What does those are the thoughts I had.Okay, I meant that in the same markets are bile violate which has nothing to do with the chemical definitions which goes in to the gas phase.Usually it has to do with popular definition where some say says it's about Violet and you think of it asYeah, but why what compound is a very predictable thing going into the gas phase at it's vapor pressure this temperature.Anyways, sorry, it's not really the point.But Herman does not always always has not truly unpredicted because I guess I've told you sort of several cause and effect type things.I guess how large the effect of any specific is difficult to predict.And everyday sort of like she gets up and it's a reset as whether it will be a good day or a bad day sing arbitrary.So that part is unpredictable.I didn't mean to be yeah, I guess I'm curious as to whether you're going to let us sit in silence for a long time or whether you had another question.It's not.It's not.but I sort ofSaid the things that I had prepared to say in some sense, I don't have a follow-up to those things.Those were pieces that I thought it was important to bring up.It's all I have and then I'm not really sure what else to say.So often when I talk for as long as I have you have otherYou're curious about things.Okay.turned into a game sort of but I'm not sure whatnot a bad way just in a funny way.You're sort of say yeah.Well, I'm curious as to what your thoughts are.So I'll just wait for you to share them and I'm saying well, I'm kind of curious as to what you're curious about.So I'll just wait.And so it's a game.I'm not meaning to set it up as part of a octagonal scheme or anything, but that looks like how is it involving?I was amused.Something like that.Yeah, and now it's lost we can't even sit in silence for long.So Tanya and I were doing couples counseling but we stopped going to see him.Little bit of both the first session.I think we both felt a little bit like he wasn't here in this.Well, we'd have to explain things went with Waze and then he would respond and he would explain it about four or five times and almost the same way this sort of response, which is clearly not how I felt interacting with you and it's not how you spell interacting with Chad.We're both relatively comfortable in those relationships.But not that other one has to confirm the specifications.But so we went back to the second session and I felt familiar, but that wasn't really the breaking point.So there's sort of about 70% of the way through where he was sort of started pressing Tanya to say what she felt like she was okay and wasn't going to kill herself because that's what he had heard from her previous session.She thought she had really said that but he's had sort of like I've seen some people try to talk to her and more private assessment in her situation, and she then she agreed with and news kind of okay the first night the second night.She was doing worse cuz of Thursday night.She works Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday 10 hours a day and so by Thursday night.It's not really she's a little more crap from them and I would say he was kind of pressing theQuestion and she wasn't very happy about it.So I suggested to him that he didn't really want to talk about the issue because I've known her for a long time and I can sort of particularly when she's interacting with somebody.I can really tell a good sense of her Moon.She kind of I didn't apparently didn't raise it very strong, but it didn't seem to him.And kind of kept pressing the question until she just said I don't want to talk about this anymore.And which there was an awkward silence in a firm denial comes with.There's a distress about the circumstances causes and her is not helpful for either of us.so that was a large part of not going back if that I mean, I don't know how you feel in response to that butOkay.Okay, like we did the wrong thing or was that a bad situation?rightRight.Yeah that honestly just isn't heard which I feel like Tanya was trying to say no that's not really good description of it.He was kind of trying to push her towards this particular description.And yeah.Well, thank you.I'm not upset with you.So just a thank you.Yeah, I think we would like another recommendation from you.But so that it gets to the other part of your question.Which was you do you just not want to be a couple counseling the answer to that is that I think couples counseling can and with the right person will help us but old certainly if we're going to be okay we're going to do that and then couples counseling is a particular venue to do certain things and certain insights and to be together and that was actually very helpful experience in the sense of uniting us against a third party.So it wasn't all bad in a lot of ways.It was like we became closer to that experience.If that makes sense.That's okay.Things are not too good.I don't know what to do.I don't know.I keep thinking things will get better things.Just don't get better.Soyes.Not much.I don't know I think a lot about killing myself and I'm not sure I have the courage.to do itYeah.Yeah, that's one way out.Okay.Yeah.It just seems like there's no good way out of this.Okay.Okay.Yeah.happyYeah, I was feeling hopeful.I want that back.Why would it?Yeah, yeah.Not closer to quite adding up.Yeah.Okay.Yeah.Okay.Yeah, I don't either.You know I intend to but the hopelessness is just it's so convincing.Yeah, it really is just gone.And I don't remember it at all.Yeah, you pointed it out to me and I sort of remember it but not really.It's like it was it wasn't even there.Yes.I don't know just feels like it clearly wasn't real.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, yeah.And I very much want to give up and want not to give up.I don't know.It's really hard.I don't know.I can I can do it for the next minute.Yeah, I can verify this chunk of time.Just not much longer.It's just really Graham.How so?Yeah, I mean, it feels like it but I don't know why.Yeah about it.Yeah.I'm afraid I'm not going to make it.I'm afraid I'll kill myself.I don't know not really to get Ethan.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, it would be the best thing that I never did.No, I have to.Yeah.Yes.Yeah.I don't think I will the stuff our stuff out of storage.So I have to have some unpacking to do.Yeah.I think it.I think I want to say it was helpful soon after the treatment itself.Yeah, it's not easy for me to tell.Yeah.Okay, I can do that.I don't know.I don't know.Okay.I think I can wait.Yeah.Thank you.What day does that?Okay.Actually, it's on the 18th this Saturday.So I was actually wondering maybe for those two weeks if we could find another time since you'll be away the next week that Monday my in-laws are leaving in the morning, which I don't know if that means I should be around or not.Yes the 20th and then I guess the 27th if there are other times those weeks.That's fine.I can probably be okay.I should probably talk to them and make sure.Yes, I can try.I should probably just clarify with them what they're doing anyway.I know it probably would because they said they were going to leave in the morning.That would probably yeah.Yeah, absolutely.I guess a little better.I'm done pretty much.I just have to finish up some research hours.Thanks and do my loan exit counseling so that's not too huge of a deal if I know that I was worked up about.I've already got my grade and I got a 97 so that was good.That was my main class.So that was good.I had a job interview at the on Friday.So that's good.And then I had sort of another pseudo interview during the week.I say pseudo because she just has to wait for her new job to be secure before her position officially open, but they already asked for my resume and gave it to her boss.So that's hopeful.that's at Walter Reed at the clinic.When I'm more interested in so yeah, it's goingsort of the one at the was a data coordinator, which it turns out.It's kind of a glorified data entry person and you don't need a master's or anything for it.The other one is actually a patient Navigator, which I don't know if you know, it's kind of a new thing.For the HIV everyone at the Walter Reed get screened for HIV and then they would get screened additionally if they're positive for the study and they pretty much have to have almost full blown AIDS or actually have full-blown AIDS and the IV drug users.So pretty serious cases Denison and IH trial is being done in 10 major cities and their three arms of the RCT.And one of them is patient navigation, you basically go with them to their doctor's appointment.You learn about their medications and their side effects you go to are there methadone clinic with them here in contact a lot with them and it's to really be a support system and encourage them to adhere that's one of the arms of the trial that sounds interesting.She also evaluates the program.So it's less Abby and more infectious disease.It was interesting and good.I just have to wait and hear what happens from her.Yeah, it was encouraging to have interviews before I'm even done and said that was helpful.I haven't even applied to that many yet.So it feels a little hopeful so that's good.Yeah, it's funny.My mom called the other day and asked I just wanted to know how your interview and your exam went and I told her and she's like and how are you feeling about yourself?Are you feeling any better about yourself?I guess answer is not really which is weird because you would think but not too much.Feels like an expectation.In fact, I felt a little silly because I'm old enough, but I told my mom that I was good and I got a 97 and she was like, of course you did.Of course.They let you interview you of course it went.Well.I know how she meant it.She meant it.Like I had no doubt I have confidence in you but it felt a little bit like, it's Baseline.So it's okay.I had a really long week just really really long days.I was exhausted but then somehow Saturday morning by 9.I'm redoing one of the kitchen cabinets and I thought okay, at least I held off I let it go during the week, but the kitchen counter was gross and I could let it go anymore.So I did that.I did one cabinet and the rest of the apartment still needed to be cleaned.I let it go.It was already clean.I just decided I wanted to rearrange it a little bit dishes and stuff like that.Saturday and Sunday, I didn't apply to any jobs I kept up with but it was okay.I'm not going to apply to any jobs.It's okay.I didn't do my loan exit counseling either which I can do online which I just want to make myself do today.So it's good but also recognize the part we were talking about like it's never enough.I guess.I'm still waiting to feel to really feel good.And now it's okay.I can get the apartment floor room cleaned, especially because everybody is coming to visit and if I get us all a job offer that I want that I accept and then I have a start date and I finish up these last couple of things that I have for school, then that's good.It's like that's the new I'm like, once that happens.There's going to be something else.So on the one hand, it's probably normal to feel relief once you get a job lined up but on the other hand, it's like there's no moment.I'm stopping and feeling just good about it's done.It's over.It's probably also because I'm terrified of school is over and it does not feel good at all to have it be over because it's all I've ever done is been the one thing for out everything in my life that has been studying and a place where even if it's baseline or it needs everybody's expectations only it still feels good and other people recognize it just being in school with all the work then deadlines and activity.Is it such a productive atmosphere?I guess.I always based my Worth or self-esteem off of doing all of that.And if I may ask my own devices what's going to happen and if I don't have those grades whatever they are, or if I can't obsess over those things to make me feel good or alleviate my anxiety.What am I going to do?I've already gone down the thought process of what if I get fired from whatever job I get which is so bizarre, but it's so typical for me to have a worst-case scenario survival plan in place.I know that's really unhealthy not proud of it.So that's scary for me on top of which I'm pretty scared that once it's over and I start working.I'm really worried that a lot of resentment is either going to be solidified or it's going to really come out especially with Ivan because it's going to be the end of the two-year agreement and he's still going to be not quite holding up his end still really struggling to stay supports a supportive things about what I've done and it's going to be over.There's going to be no room to correct it fix it deal with it and I worry about that.We just agreed that I was going to go to school for two years and we agreed that Ivan was going to work full time for 2 years.That was pretty much it.There wasn't really all those kind of implied before the whole grad school thing happened.It was implied that Ivan was going to be working for those two years and he was hopefully going to be getting started on his PhD or getting its better job and I would probably just work for a while.I really worry about that and it sounds like I can't get over it.I mean I can't evidently and I don't want to be like that.I don't want to carry around this Grudge, but I'm worried that that's what's going to happen.And I'm also worried that and whatever happens with him.I'm not going to have this cool thing.That's kept me afloat to hang on to hang onto and what if I'm not good at my job and what if it doesn't pan out and what is my co-workers don't like me and what if there is no Baseline measure of success.I don't know.I feel all of this pressure to either get the perfect job that pays a lot of money or what if I don't have anything for a while and then I could be applying or not applying like he has been and just in this limbo it feels right now like no matter what I do.I'm really scared that it's going to bring that issue with us.Yeah, I'm really worried.It also feels like the one place.I've always been where I get recognized for doing well and varying levels, but also all the adults are responsible and there their and they're reliable is an environment where I can count on other people wear.It's a very strict expectation.If this professor didn't get back to you.Just isn't allowed to happen.They have their people to answer to there are all of these other people who are doing the same thing.I guess.It's still supported it still safe.How can going to school be a bad thing?You're doing something really good and productive this contributing.Yeah.Like it's a place where people who are potential have to use it at some level.They all have to I guess I feel like my parents and I've been there so much potential and they don't have to fulfill it.I'm also a little scared that it's going to be hard because it's the one area in which my dad to talk.You can talk about school.He can talk about work and that's like it and he's already he wants me to go to vet school.Pretty much.I was pretty bad undergrad.That was my focus.He would never say that but you still like what about those jobs with I know a couple of people at school Corvette.What about contacting them?It's not something that I'm opposed to but I just feel like he's still really want so I guess it's a little scary.Go about 2 because it's the one area in which he always looks Babe Ruth favorably upon me.Right and I'll have that if I get a good job, I will have that but I already feel pressure because he's like now don't take the first offer you get Ramona.If someone does give you an offer you don't have to rush I feel this pressure.I know he probably doesn't mean to put it that way between that and my mother-in-law continually harping on the CDC.I'm just like I really just want to get something and whatever I get I want people to not make a fuss but I want them to have something positive to say instead of always.Okay, but you could have done especially in light of what's been going on.Even if you don't think it's fair or his parents to say he's managing a coffee shop and that's just the way it is, but why aren't you working for one of the biggest organization?It feels like all of All or Nothing it feelsBut I'm not going to let that work we have it's my job and I'm going to do what I want or what I'm capable of doing.That would be the healthy way to go about it.Yeah, that's the thing.My parents were never in my entire life asked me or to my knowledge call me to work on homework or study for an exam to have done that would have been an insult.In fact, sometimes my dad even just in grad school if you like.Well, I know you got to study that type of thing which is kind of insulting because coming from them they would just never have asked us to our assignments or anything like that because we were never not going to do them.It's just the way things were.Yeah.rightYes, I don't feel like there was ever a situation know and I never said like we need you to get all A's or we would love you more if you got all A's, but it was also never a big deal.Sometimes we go to dinner at the end of the school year something or once we did get a report cards, but it's not like a let's go celebrate.They never did that.But my dad did have a tough time the first time I got a D in chemistry test time.It was just a marking.Grade.It wasn't my total grade.But I done very poorly on the exam and it wasn't because I hadn't studied.I'm still about a chemistry kind of but he was just speechless.He didn't say anything and then there was a parent-teacher conference that came up and he went in and spoke to my chemistry teacher alone and wanted to know what I should be doing.And then he's preparing for the next exam and telling me okay sample ballot questions that your professor thinks the exam is really based on the bus.So you need to be doing these instead.I know he meant well, but it felt a little difficult because I wasn't stalking off that would have been one thing I guess.Yeah, but I think my dad would never think of it that way because he works insanely hard his dad work insanely hard knowing whatever it would be like an insult if someone asked him to go to work or ask him to apply to a job because it's just understood expected Baseline.Yeah.I guess I have a situation in which I got really upset about it, which is really weird for me.No within the last couple of years my friend Judy from college a really great friend.I really love her.She's wonderful, but we're different in a lot of ways.She did this internship down a Disney.She likes to cook and she did this cooking program for 1 year giant college came back from the internship and she moved in with her parents and she didn't have a job until May and he came back around Thanksgiving and they were totally fine with this because she was like if I had if I take a bad job, I know myself and I want to fight anymore.So they just let her not do any and my parents would never let me this is unthinkable.So I guess the thing that's I did have I had Carl actually look up about the possible hormone issue from last last week because I wanted to say I was afraid that if I was looking I could tell it was sort of thing.That was that was that with what the state of how I was feeling at the time that it was just going to sort of trigger the same reactions over again.I looked it up that looking up was just going to bring you down again.So ask Carl if you check it out and he found that it basically there were a lot of women that were talking about it online and I definitely made me and then I could tell you know after the next day I was feeling a bit better and then the day after that I was feeling basically normal again.So yeah, it was obviously there was something something hormonal going in there and that was the sort of triggering that sort of response.What was interesting that yesterday.I started to get I got one of my more normal sort of.Zelonis and I think because it came so soon after I was able to compare what was going on.And the things I noticed was I was at home in the afternoon when I was starting to feel it already that in the morning.But when I was at home with Genevieve in the afternoon car was out and Genevieve is great, but she's not much of a conversationalist.I was sort of I guess focusing and thinking on it and I realize that I really needed to go for a walk.I needed to take her and go out for a walk and that would make me feel much better.If I could just take Genevieve and go for a walk what you did we walk to work because it was a half hour walk and that was around the time when Carl usually comes home.So we walked there and then walk back and it was and I saw and yes the sort ofThe exercise and fresh air and pushing myself to go out was not solving any problem, but I did help sort to sort of bring it back in his perspective.I guess in a way which was totally different from when I had that sort of that issue earlier with the and when I got my.And I was going outside and it's what I remember from before when I was in high school or going outside walking with something that it didn't help any I just it was going on and I just had sort of ride it out.If I was outside, then it meant that I was trying to prevent myself from crying in public as opposed to cry at home and it probably wasn't very helpful because you know, then my what I want to do is just start hide at home, so I won't go outside and crime public.So it was that was just sort of an interesting with an interest in contrast for me.I guess in a sense just sort of think about what's something that I can what areas are the sort of things to work on or dwell on in a way and what sort of things that are obviously just well that's a physical thing.That's not really in my control right now and I can't really go in there and manipulate what my cells are doing.I guess it was coming out from I don't even really know exactly what was either triggering or just going on yesterday.It sounds funny but I think part of it was just it was gray.So I felt gray.I don't think I was the only one there only for students who came to get reception yesterday.So normally I have time to 12 but it was then sort of dwelling a lot in my life.Since last week was was thinking about the dead if you're feeling really bad about feeling bad I guess and I was like, I think one of the funny thing about it is that it doesn't really feel like it's the trait isn't here in our natural to me.It feels like it's sort of I guess call and Isis part of me.Funny cuz you know, it's sort of a and obviously it's the response to Pasta.So it's pardon me, I guess and just another way to twist it around.It's something that I don't really like and it's just another way of putting it butI think that one of the one of the interesting aspects but when I was thinking about it before was the connection I made with you know that I'm very conscious that it does come from but it does come from growing up with Leah who is very very focused on the shoulders and I ought to should not tooth and that kind of idea of personality and well it sort of got me thinking a little bit about these are not just of that if personality of Leah is very much.She's very particular which means that she often times ends up with a lot of you know, it's he carried it far but she does end up with a lot of things that produce a lot of really great things.So well, you know it was but I could tell that that's wearing me a lot of this sort ofIt would definitely have an enormous influence Over Me growing up.She's my big sister.And I mean my parents point out that as of a certain age when we were kids if you look at us and pictures via is always looking at the camera and I'm always looking at Leah I we were just we were very close and I adored and I do adore her.She's my sister and I love her but at the same time that I fully know that that influence had in some respects it led me into great places and I read great things and I tried out things and so on but in other respects it I know that some of that a lot of those aspects of myself which hold back while myself back come from her ideas and ideals and the sorts of rules that she sets a place for herself which carried over into me it sort of I'm not a person who has a lot of very clear memories from when I was a kid.So but when I look back at when I try to sort of cast my mind back to get more oppression andWhat are my specific memories come from when I was a little bit older usually after when I was in grade 3 we move to Cleveland for a year.My father had a sabbatical year and we moved back to Frank which is where I grew up and it runs like for grade 4 and 5 and then when I was going into 6th grade 6 we move to Cleveland permanently and around then is when more specific memories really start and I'm really sure it's because when I was a little kid, I was basically just sort of zoned out pretty heavily.I didn't have a huge number of friends or anything and I didn't care because I didn't really need them because I had my friend Jen I have the and so I said when I was at a friend's house often would end up sort of quietly with the parents because I wasn't very rambunctious in my personality and I was just I was pretty happy moving to Cleveland.Although ultimately had a lot of good for me.I don't think it was much too short of traumatic for me and either grade 3 or an a grade civics.I was very unhappyand I'm pretty sure my parents didn't really realize how much because I wasn't it's not that I wasn't I wasn't very talkative about things I just I'm more or less left.To lie again you know I should know what things were right to say so she would do the talking and I'm not they knew that grade 3 wasn't my best year but I don't think that they recognized when we moved the Cleveland and grey sex scene when I wasn't happy about it you knew that I really didn't want to leave Jenna particular Jen was my best friend still is I don't think they realized I'm in fact I'm sure that they didn't realize that grade 6 is going to be the best for me it was an incredibly painful urineFirst of all, I just really really miss jen-jen there two friends who have meant the most to me Jenn and Lucy Jen I think of her I it's funny.I usually Hobbies ideas.But when, what comes to mind with Jen is yellow golden Sunny yellow when they got married and had this idea at first it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding not usually all about the clothes for sure, but IAdd s i t a r i a nice yellow dress and then everything changed upside down and then I was going to be an evening wedding and my mom thought I should get a fancy dress.So I got a fancy or dress.I wasn't so thrilled with having a fancy dress, but it was nice, but I got a green one and I like green.But when Jem Genting I just looked at her and I saw just I went to my closet and I gave her the dress cuz I realized I'd gotten her I'd gotten hadn't gotten this dress for me.I got in it for then she wore it in it and just sunshine.It's she's I mean a very a laughing person.She's one who what she she always had pets growing up and I love that because when I went to her house, I got to play with her dogs with her cats going to have passed because my parents only I were all allergic so I got them sort of vicariously through Jen and it really really hurt me to leave leave her because she's just on top of just being so cheerful and making the best of things very accepting a little bit more.I guess more impulsive less less held back by things in my with my personality.It was something that I like to see it was a pretty big wrench to leave her.Also.I just it's funny when I lived in Frankfurt either fewer people and it was quieter and all of that which is more in line with my personality.Begin with but I was not empty your place, but I never felt really lonely there when we moved the Cleveland which was full of people all over the place and you can never be alone.I felt very lonely being surrounded by business annoys people time.And then what was really hard and 6th grade was I started in grade 6 was I started in a school with my parents just said there was a language immersion school system.I started in language immersion.I'm sorry is school system.And so I thought it was the best way to continue our culture.It was also a private school where my mother was teaching but it was going to it was first of all there weren't they weren't sure about putting me into school where my mother was teaching.Cultural immersion is the technical terms in Midwest and the school was where in a more cultural neighborhood of the city fathers North start of getting into the more cultural territory and they were hoping that would be that would continue my language education, which is something I was definitely gung-ho about as well.I've always love languages and I certainly ardently love French literature still do half of what I work on our different languages.So is all sort of for a very good plan and practice it turned out to be really really awful the students were it was not a good fit for me at all, but it turned out that my class is run by a student who my memory from the first day of class, but she rounded up all the girls in the class and put us around in a circle and she stood in the middle and based on shoes.She went around said you're basically you're in you're notIt was called it was in grade 6 in Cleveland.This was the other one my mother taught at the French school, which is a private school.This was public part of the public school system.Yeah.I thought he that bad this one before I was sort ofwe moved the Cleveland not for his job.We moved there because in grade 3 we went on a sabbatical then my father is he left his job in Frankfurt?He was a professor at the University there any left for a number of reasons that year they had been planning on it already.They wanted to move back to Cleveland because they wanted to for my perspective in grade 6 it was in but they wanted to move there for Education the new that the quality of Education dropped after Elementary School in Frankfort, and they wanted us to have a better education also Jewish Community which just didn't exist in Frankfurt.So it was really in a funny way of the spur funny to me now if it was for us it definitely didn't feel that way at the time.I really love Frankfort and I miss everything about it.We have had a much easier transition and I think a part of what was sort of wrenching for me was that before then?I haven't really been really intense with Leah, you know, she was much more social than I was she had more friends.She had more she was more of an extrovert.She was just moreOut of there.She had the ideas.I went with her plans, but and she missed Frankfort.It's just a she has this kind.She also has this kind of Ideal view of Frankfort.So sometimes email me that she's going home sick and she misses the sort of Simplicity and beauty and niceness of it almost need sometimes when I read those emails.It feels like I'm reading a fairytale.It's not how I remember things.I don't remember like yes, it was beautiful.It was really I loved it.But I remember Winters being extremely hard and we had that 6 foot snow storm sure.It was pretty and it's something sort of talked about looking back.But at the time it was pretty hard a lot of mosquitoes in the summer insanely painful.There are not mosquitoes like that anywhere else, but I don't know it's just something about it feels a bit unreal and it certainly like for her the transition was she had an okay year at school.Then she went to the high school which we both attended jade made a lot of friends there and her husband now is one of somebody who was in her class in high school.It was allfinal smelly for her I had a real struggle until I Grace 6 if I could erase it I would grade 7 I went to a different school it was just a grade 7/8 school so smaller I'd had teachers if you were a little bit more specialized in dealing with that rather difficult Agency Group and one of my still sort of halfway in touch with some of my teachers from their who is extremely patient and sweet with me and that's where I'm at my friends see who liked genchi you know both of them interesting me they never went to University or a couple of years and then which were Lucy never went to University there more the people who ball to doWhat they want they do it.They're both very much creatures of the place where they live Jen tried to have tried a number of times to leave Frankfurt or the east coast and she never could she never could live elsewhere.Now.She's living in Iceland that's about as much of a deviation as she can make from there and I cannot imagine losing anywhere other than Cleveland and it's kind of interesting me to me that the two friends.I need to sort of anchor me in a way are those people who sort of moved to their own Rhythm or not?So concerned about conventions or making or was perfectly right all the time.They don't worry about making mistakes because I'll just try again later.just sort of getting trying to think back because a lot of what I you know, a lot of what I itsfunneh a lot of what I know about my growing up with LeoAnd is what I heard my parents or other people in a way because I said my own memories are kind of sparse from when I was younger.My mom.My dad will comment on Leah being kind of bossy Kind Of Man armor marked many times me that although you've always been very protective of David.Or her telling me that she remembers that I would always be very excited when Jen came over to play but I usually end up sitting somewhere else.I'll be up late with Jen and I have a memory which is I was always very excited to go over to Jen's house play partly I think because of the animals the cats and it's also partly because I did I don't remember from when I was littler but when I was older, I definitely remember certainly back they had to sense of Jen because we were the same being very much my friend and then Leah wanted to play with us all the time and I sometimes felt a little bit left out, I guess in a Party of Three instead of a party of two.I think I had a sense that I wasn't very good at having friends when he came back from Cleveland.I think that's when I start began to sort of feel that difference between we are being quite good socially and me being sore.Focus on the outside not really knowing how to play.I feel like I wasn't very good at being a kid.I had a and of course like now I look and I think they're all kinds of kids.I just had a feeling that I wasn't very good at it that I probably seem to get along better with many adults.Of course now when I think about it, I probably just didn't really find a good group of kids.I wasn't or didn't have a kind of chameleon personality, which I can fit in with very many people.I still don'tBut I remember when I I guess this was around and grade for grade 5 when we came back from Cleveland before we moved permanently when I was on the in the playgrounds girls at lunch or recess or something, and I wanted to play at the only things I ever really wanted to play.Or some type of fairies or miss or something like that.I read fairy tales I dread mythology.I was obsessed.andand who grew up on a farm nearby and sure she was very nice.But we tended to butt heads as much as I could.I wasn't really very good at that sort of thing.But she was she wanted to play horses because she grew up on a farm.She loves horses the way that I love cats in mythology and she loves horses.She loves the things that you saw every day.And I said, okay.Yeah, that's fine.We'll play horses.I don't know nothing about horses.So I wanted to be Pegasus because that was the horse.I knew she was Furious she was so angry because I still don't really know very much about horse says it could be a black horse or White Horse.I don't really know anything about horses a mare a stallion.I guess the horses don't have wings.There wasn't a horse on her Farm Gladwin, so can't do that.And that's what I was, you know.It's just that sort of that's where I was like with other kids.And so I just and the great thing about being backed about back in Cleveland was when I her it was sort of like she readEvery she just there's a reason I think.It was in all of them the course textbooks and she just read everything in my way.I felt at that point was that it gave me enough for somebody to hang out with just let me Mark time until so I guess I reach the more it's I wanted to go to university.I wanted to go to university not because just because I wanted the courses and the more, you know being able to write about what I wanted to write and she's my classes and I wanted to go to university because you didn't have lunch hour you didn't have recess you don't have a cafeteria where all the kids going to have to find a table to sit with other people.I found extremely stressful.you hadI tried to live in a dorm for 2 years, but then since I was in Cleveland, I just I live at home for the next two years because I didn't the messing it's just got to be too much and after that was justGreater degrees that sort of Independence I guess but of course the thing is at all of these those stages in between are supposed to teach you about getting along and making compromises and so on and I guess what's really the something that wasn't I guess it's not an issue of getting along and making compromises.I do both of those things extremely.Well, I'm not the most social person in the world, but I definitely don't mind, you know people who are different from your with no major issues that I didn't manage to workout in the stages of how to say in that that okay.You don't have to like my shoes.Why would I care whether you like my shoes are not they're comfortable.They work they provide that layer between my feet in the ground.They're supposed to do if you don't like them fine.You don't have to it's not your business.That's a problem that I didn't manage to work on those stages, I think.Yeah.Yeah.I guess that'sOkay.So yeah.Yeah.Yeah, it's in.Hi Carl, can I call you back?Yeah, it's just that it's it's true.It's like a sort of a I guess the thing is that to me.It's a I think that what I like what I just reached right now where my instinct was.Yes compromise.That's what you need to to.That's what you didn't learn.That's what you know, you put children.They get more social and they compromised and learnt work together.I had to turn down a little bit now.I can't go anyway.Yeah.Okay, I think that once preschool I'll end up driving on Tuesdays, but just something it's I driven once and it's opposite direction for traffic.So it's not bad.Yeah, and I would just walk back to my apartment because it's really easy to part around my apartment weirdly.Like I wasn't expecting that but yeah.Oh, yeah, that's right.So it was a good trip.You know, it's sort of odd starting again, you know, like when you go on a weekend trip, it doesn't actually feel like a weekend.They're really good friends like very into us they seemed very relaxed about it, which is nice.Yeah, they were in Ohio where the wife Carrie was director of stocks and bonds and then her adviser moved to Springfield.And so now they're like half an hour away from her family, which is like nice and also bad.So yeah why we were there we helped Cody set up the crib because they're calling every other day to ask do you haveThe crib set up yet, and they're like the baby's not going to sleep in the crib until it's like at least several months old.It's really okay.So they took a picture of us with the crib and said it it made me feel like the benefits of neglect for my parents.Like well, it wasn't great when I was a kid.But at this point either that whatever they think is okay is like make comments about my weight.For example.Yeah, it's not all that great.It was good for James and I should be able to like we should really long ride together.We talked about his field and what we're going to do and after you finish his degree and where we want to be and what we found and what we would want to be doing.We pretty much agreed that we don't want to be back in Columbus, and we wouldn't want to be in the Midwest.Did some breathing space and James got to take a couple of days off and that was good.I told Cody and Carrie about the ECT and we touch on we talked about that sure.They just want to know about it and asking interesting questions.So we talk.I feel like James and I are really worried that I will suddenly get dramatically worse.Amazingly enough.James doesn't like it when I make jokes about suicide and sometimes I forget them.I was sorry.Maybe it's one thing that would be good for a while.My roommate finally emailed me back.Yeah, and was like, yeah, that sounds great in like July.She's going to come.I don't know.I just think we're sort of on the same page.You're a nice person whom I like and we're probably not going to be friends.I'm pretty okay with that.I was thinking she takes a lot of work.She probably feels the same way about me.It takes a lot of work to be her friends.It's good to be around friends.James sounds like he feels like he doesn't make friends easily.and I feel like it's easy for me to make friends, but I tend to make friends with people who are kind of likeKaty Perry's husband, he talks like so much.He just talked for 48 hours.It's amazing.I go to bed and he be talking and I'd get up and meet me talkin and he talked it's great.It's not like he's talking about the same things.He just has a lot of ideas.I don't know what to talk about.So I feel like if I hold my nose just so everything will be okay.It isn't likeYeah a little bit.I was pretty bad a few weeks ago like just beginning of the weekend.I was real sad, and I'm not right now.And so I'm just babbling on.Are you that happens sometimes?Yeah, that stuff.I can't figure out what that is, but that's okay.It seems like you know, it seems like that's all they just seem.Unclear which particular personally I think is right and partially is really anxious.Oh, well, I better not mess with anything.Yeah, I don't know at what point I start feeling safe.I think it would be more like must I start feeling safe then more than I forget that I am not safe, and I'm not.It's not that recognizing that I'm not save doesn't begin to protect me or anything like that.What you said to him last week was very helpful.Yeah, what's going on with James is also not monolithic.Speaking of save a story from my childhood my grandparents.I might have told you the story already.My grandparents lived in this nice big old cabin, not really a cabin but like a wood house on and as they got older they were really I suspect they were really never much for cleanliness based on the way.I was raised my standards from are different from other people's as I have learned like soap is necessary good to know so likeYeah, they never really like nothing ever got clean.There was like a film of grease on their clean dishes and like all their food would go bad in the fridge.Like they just left it there.They probably shouldn't have been living there by themselves but like no one was going to tell them what to do.I was like 10 or so and we are visiting and we had a friend of the family visiting us to have never been there before so he was trying to make coffee and like where is the coffee pot?And he pulled some milk out of the fridge and turned and said is this safe and we were like nothing is safe.I'm not telling some of my dad's I'm not telling some of my dad's favorite stories about his parents at this point or about our interactions with his parents.Did not eat anything the whole trip.We'd like bring food every time we came.Was maybe four or five maybe a little bit older but not much and being their drink daffodil season and they have like thousands of daffodils and I just picked them all.I just think all of them and put them all over the house and they were totally fine with that.I ended up talking about family with Carrie.I think Terry's family is driving Cody kind of meds.I think Vincent to us was a way of continuing to be gracious to them.Where say people you know, they're thinking a lot about family about to have a kid thinking about them a little sad James and I are so far from that don't necessarily have toYeah, we're just not ready to have a kid.I think both of us would like to be.I really can't take care of James right now.Can take care of a child and also more broadly.I mean I can really see the ways that the crazy has been passed down through the generations to me and like I don't know how to make it stop.Play both sides of my grandparents is nuts or were you know, yeah pretty unhappy and neither kids pretty unhappy and now I'm pretty unhappy.I don't know how you stop that.I had a face with encounter with my aunt who is my mom's sister who was a psychologist even moved to Utah to be an artist.She's nuts.I try to avoid talking about psychology with her.She's always ends up talking about that's just not helpful for me.You know in some ways it makes sense growing up in the household.She did of course.She's a psychologist adults you figure out the shit out.I really want to have a family I want to have children.In a lot of ways, I think I'd be really good at it.Like now, I mean, I don't mean that I do actually when I said that I feel like the more I sort of get better.Whatever that looks like.I just feel like the pressure is on to be well.I want to say that I think that's too much pressure for Chad.Yeah.I don't never going to I know that I just can't stop both trying and feeling like it's vitally important that I do.Like you and James always have the option of leaving and never feeling pressured.Yeah.Yeah.I have well.Behind this I feel that we can have a better life without me and for me when I think about James leaving me.I just can't handle it all there's nothing after that.Yeah, probably.Yeah, it does.I feel like when I'm worried about things getting bad, I feel like things could be bad tomorrow or even today and likebut I'm not sure that I would ever leave James.I feel like at least now that if you push me hard, I would always say that.Yeah.Yeah, but sometimes that is a lot.Sometimes the attitude that people would be better off without me just gets immediately answered by you know, that's not the way things are and I'm glad you're in my life and so it will be okay.Yeah.Yeah, I worry about every about people getting hurt by me.You know, I think what I was thinking about suicide a lot at least part of it was at least I won't have to see it when I inevitable having to see it orJames is off for the I'm pretty sure he's worried about my ability to be alone for a few weeks.Like he got groceries and figured out what bills were going to come out the next over the next two weeks.Yeah, and I have all the like I've been all the bills, you know, I asked him at some point.I need to figure out this and I sort of meant it as I need to go.Into all the stack of claims and he had documented this weekend.I'm going to see mine in the city.So I'm excited about that.I think I'll leave but I'm excited.I'm talking to a class on Friday and I Sunday like I I actually do well on buses and trains most things that I enjoyed.I do enjoy that I can do stationary.I don't like the very much.Jackson and Serena, especially Jackson is fascinated by knitting.He doesn't want to learn how to do it.Selena wants to learn.He doesn't want to do that.He just wants to watch me do it which is fine, but I can't really sit and be holding a baby Ur doing something like that for somebody else for longer than 45 seconds.But at his request I'm making him up.It's finally he's very anxious in some ways.He's learning to ride a bike with training wheels.And I think it's sort of hard to sell his parents that I took them out yesterday and he's going really well, but I think he's very anxious.You know telling me about it, like ritualizing thing like brushes his teeth five times washes his hands five times and everything five times.Well, you know, I'm not sure you need to do it like 5 times.I sort of passed the information along to his parents of if it concerns them.Yeah, that'd be great.Yeah, he's graduating up from like a balance bike thing to a training wheel bike.Thanks.El Paso onGood, of course now Jackson was really excited to leave Selena's balance bike.And now she just wants to ride the other bike the one he actually has.coolYeah, I never see them Balance Bike before but it's a new thing.Okay.Thanks.Has decided she will never sleep again.Like life is way too interesting to be asleep.Yes, I mean in practice.It means I get to keep her up until she's cranky enough that she falls asleep faster, but she's like just go into the room with the crib.She's like, oh no.This is not going to happen lucky me.She said that she doesn't like she won't sit still long enough for you to change your diaper.So you just have to come up like Russell with her while you're trying to change her diaper.I'm not sure how I feel about James leaving, but it'll be nice to have time alone.I don't want to leave James I've decided what I'm going to wear in my cousin's wedding.I don't want to go it's expensive.My aunt would be really sad if I missed it.But it's just another how reasonable is it for me to need to go do this and the incense to ask James to go with me.This is my cousin who is like I mean, like I want to say this is my cousin.From my aunt and uncle who are nuts but it's like two-thirds of them at least so these are for cars Matt karizmatik people I've ever met like very very talented and very sort of nuts ways.So Lillian the one who's getting married the same age as my sister by like 4 days, I think both Amanda and I have always been like kind of jealous of them, but she's like not so much that they got their shit together because they really don't but they really don't seem bothered by it at all.It's funny watching Amanda and Lillian both of them when they walk into the room are instantly the center or focus of the room.It's just how they work.I think Amanda sees that that in Lillian but doesn't see that in herself entertaining because there's a lot of people who usuallyWhen they talk into the room are the focus of the room, sometimes that ends up going badly, but usually it's just really good.I have not met Williams fiance.Their father is a minister and their mom worked in Portland Public School for a long time.I think she was like an education specialist shoe was that like we sort of realize that when we got older but whatever.My dad doesn't know what to do with his kids.He calls her and she gives him a bye.So for years quite recently he told us he gotThe divorcee called Philip in and or Philip and she was like you need.Her name is Philip.Yeah, which is a family name.Yeah, we name both girls and boys fell upon our family is very confusing for some people actually know we didn't used to but my aunt felt was pretty involved in the women's movement in the 70s.So when her older brother my uncle had a second child, he named himself after her so I'm not sure if it was a tribute or making fun of her it was probably both but she called her and she said you need a housekeeper and you need a nanny like this is what you need to do.Like here's how you're going to deal with your life wife leaving you so she's like the greatest person which I think she always seems she always thinks she knows what to do always takes charge.She had a daughter Kelly who died beforeLike that was her first child.So before any of us were born I didn't actually find out about her until my grandfather died.Listen to hear that's how I found out about her.I don't think anybody was like nobody was keeping it a secret.It was just like nobody talks about her or at least my dad never talked about it.We didn't see these cousins that often and I found out about it because we she's buried at the same church that my grandfather grandparents are buried at it was clearly like so present and so real fur fill up and for and Wyatt, I hadn't known about it, and it was clearly really to all the aunts and uncles as well.I didn't know.Nobody's named Kelly which there like 9?Ulysses 7 Linens and a whole bunch of Phillips.I guess male names when you get taxed on more tightly than female names.And of course feeling embarrassed or ashamed I didn't even know who Kelly was it like I asked him made dad and made dad kind of like what's wrong with you.Nobody told me.I haven't talked to him about session us filing claims.It seems like not a good time trying to pack and trying to get ends tied up and trying to set up like a work to do when he gets there.I feel like I'm getting what do I mean getting?I feel like I'm much more timid around him.Then that's good for me or has been done for a relationship.You know, certainly I've been timid with lots of people.second offerDisappointment I think the hardest part for Jackson is that he's not found.He's not quite strong enough to act Ashley turn the pedals when he not going very fast, you sort of afraid to go fast enough to get momentum Soho starts to go and then we'll start going and then stop and get frustrated because of pedals are right and he can't push them down.The pedals don't seem to be working.Well that well.When I was nine or 10 somebody took a picture of me riding a bicycle and reading at the same time.Add the same thing happening to me what books I always used to I'd like to share a novel and I just wouldn't be able to stop until I finish the book like I don't care about anything else.Like I just want to finish a book.I just want to keep reading.I mean I read fast which is good, but it's a little bit scary to get enough caught in a narrative like in some ways nothing else in my life matters.Yeah.The problem is that eventually you have to put the book down.Not that I haven't tried and then I feel bad just the day being gone.I had these things I was planning on doing today.Yeah.He sort of asked why I'm sad.He asked about it.I'm not going to tell him I'd rather be dead.I feel like he's taking care of me in so many ways that he wants from me or that he needs for me is for me to be okay, and I can't get them up.And then I feel like I'mhelp a lot.Things are hard copy.Yeah, I serve gone it through my head that this is the best way I can take care of him is to take care of myself, but then I can't take care of myself.I can't be okay.Yeah, but maybe not for quite the same reasons.They seem like there's a similarity there, you know, like both of you make me be alive and that's something a part of me can really get behind and is really committed and part of me and can'tYeah in the sense of like I'm committed to being but what I'm trying to do a large chunk of me doesn't want to do that.I can't you know that sort of something I can take out and look at and then I have to put it away like I have to spend not too much time with it.But when I don't spend any time with it, I beginning to feel like nothing I do is authentic.Yeah.Have a very clear and focused very clear in my head.But like this is the place that I can cry when I need to but not for longer than 5 minutes.I guess so, I guess I feel like it feels to me and I think that this is more me than you feels like to me as though the limits you have with you.I can tell you about the self terrible self-destructive things and feelings, but my attitude towards them has to be of one wanting to be better.how neglectfulokay.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.Thanks for drive safe.Good morning.I'm really glad that you could see me today.Yeah, that's the about it.Yeah, that's about right.Yeah, I'm having sort of a tough time.I couldn't find my pants this morning.This is it just feels like a classic morning for me and some ways.I don't like talking last night and I was like, okay, I'm going to wear these jeans tomorrow and I put them somewhere and then this morning they were gone like totally gone.And I just remember I put them in a drawer with my shirt which I found after like 15 minutes of like where are my pants?I don't know.I've been looking around my apartment for things a lot more often than I typically to it's like most stuff.You don't end up staying for 1 year.To the next but maybe that's just me, but I broke my glasses a few days ago, and I had a backup somewhere.That was Despair and I like couldn't find them and I knew that I had an that I hadn't thrown them away because I was keeping them for this precise eventuality and James knew he hadn't thrown them away because he didn't know where they were and I didn't know where they were.And so I ended up looking everywhere in the apartment.My apartment is like about twice the size of this office like it's not very big.And there are not many places but like under the bed and I think I ended up like finding a lot of stuff that I couldn't remember and also a lot of stuff that remembered but didn't want to think about like I found my Sasha flash card like thousands of flash cards on tiny little pieces of cardboard tied together with rubber bands and a bag and like I found that bag and then like I found this beautiful very nice hiking pack that I didn't remember or like I recognized it but I didn't know where I was from and I didn't know I had it and James was like, yeah.That was your birthday present last year.So it's been like, I don't know.James really doesn't want to go to this wedding and you know, he's been pretty like I don't know.I think he's doing as well as he can in terms of both being cheerful and cooperative and like not saying that he wants to go to the wedding because he doesn't want to go I sort ofI sort of want to go but I'm really tired from this week and then going to be more tired by the end of the weekend.It's not like I'm melting down over little things but I think it's mostly because I like I can't get to the point where I'm actually melting down over little things like it's like I think it's actually worse.I'm kind of like Frozen and sad and really upset and don't know what to do about it.Somehow I have to refill my prescription on Monday or by Monday.And I know that I'm going to not going to remember to do it like I know this but like I couldn't have done it today we got but I couldn't have really doesn't today.There's as much time in the West Des Moines.I've ended up missing like two or three days on my thyroid medication because I had run out on a Tuesday and then I can't get out until Friday and then I don't really want to move on Friday morning and I just made my life.There's also like four or five events in two days for the sweating right?It's 3 days, but like it's just all parties like all the time.It's like sort of going to be great and I sort ofI just skipped some but I also can't skip them because there is are my cousins whom I love and I don't see I see the multi here.And I don't know James last night was like do you think we can be angry all the time?And I was like totally and because like Oliver had just gotten worse than he was in a really bad place like he was ship faced wrong.And you really like James and he really kind kind of wanted to mess with him a lot at the end of the evening.She was like I'm going to pick you up Oliver Oliver is like 5657.He's like a big guy for a little guy like over 6 foot and James's over and was like sure why not.I will make you happy.So we're going to be like tonight.I don't know whether Oliver's happy but his coffee shop is so that's nice and he has started the coffee company, which is a cafe in Maryland that somehow all of my friends who really really like so that's kind of nice.It's like the most hipster coffee shop in Maryland.I've gone to the point in my job where it's not so hard every week and it was hard this week.But in general it's like less than clearly exhausting.So I've started panicking that I'm not doing a good job anymore.Sharon has started trying to say my name which considering like she has three words.I feel really good about you know, she doesn't say anything really remotely approximating.My name but clearly she's trying to apparently.Is really hard for small children.Like it's one of the hardest consonants.Yeah, it's more like and then she gets the egg in the end in there and she doesn't like she doesn't Babble that much or like she makes a lot of noise, but she doesn't have a whole lot of different consonants more like...... And then like noise.She's getting bossy or so.We'll see how this that goes.I think she really likes climbing up the stairs and when I don't want to climb up the stairs with her, which is most of the time she gets really mad.We're just too bad.She's really funny when she's mad like I'm trying to take you seriously, but you're not even a year old and you're argh.I feel like I should work harder on coming up with things to do.Like places to go like I don't know.I feel like I'm running out of things to talk about because I am well I talked about all of the things that are like sort of pretty much bothering me at the bothering me and not the things that are really really bad because I don't want to talk about things that are really really bad.And I also imagine that you don't want to hear about things that are really really bad and aren't actually that I don't know.And they're not incurred in anything.I just feel like shit and I just hate myself more than most of the time.I have to go to weddings.I have to like fine all my dresses and then that makes me and that makes me that doesn't help.So I have to bring dress sense for Amanda.Also, she got into a situation where all of her dresses are at her boyfriend's house and she really needs to break up with her boyfriend and she didn't have it in her.So do it so like the night before she was leaving she did was alright get off.It'll be okay.So I'm bringing like a dresses because there was like five things to do.And I don't feel very good about any of them.And I don't know why it matters so much.I did suggest to Amanda that she not caught off all her hair.Yeah, and probably for emotional reasons, but I don't think it would look as good on I don't think it would look as good on you.So we'll see.I don't know why we're still in the dynamic of where Amanda thinks that I'm like sensible responsible one or like the one who has all of her shit together.I don't know why she thinks that but somehowMoxa Dynamic that were in I don't know what to do about your life Amanda.I don't know what to do about my life.The only thing I really know is that I think that you should be in therapy and you don't really react to that soI mean considering all these experiences with therapist.I don't blame her, but I know how I don't know how else to say it.She's in San Antonio.I don't know whether she'll stay there.I think most of the time when Amanda has gone to therapy.It's been to get something made her because they thought that something is wrong with her and she hasn't been very happy about it.We're very happy with the experience.I've been writing again.So that's good.Yeah.Yeah, I mean, I always want to come to therapy and it's a mostly if I don't I feel worse but then it's actually like yeah, but now I have to actually do it.I don't get that far.But yeah, I must go maybe.Yeah, yeah, I didn't do as much but it is much harder for me when we don't meet at soft and yeah, not all the time but a lot of the time.Yeah, I think so.Meaning a few times a week seems to be okay.Okay.I'm not sure what's going to happen with Monica's job.Did I tell you about her possibly having to resign?Okay.So this is like at the beginning of the week or the beginning of last week.I don't know no actually was last week the center.She works for is the founder of the CEOs kids there.so before he started he likes checked it out with it at 6 commission to be like hey is this going to be a conflict of interest and they said no just rest recuse yourself from anything to do with that and he checked it out again and initially they said no it's fine and then they said we're goingThe the statement saying that you need to either cut all ties or resign not just from the race for governor, but also being a senator so she went to work one day last week and was like, I'm going to have it.I'm going to have to cool it like he's going to resign today.He didn't end up resigning but like in the next month he's going to basically figure out what he can do about it.So, I don't know.What's going to happen with their job?Which means that I don't know what's going to happen to my job.You know, I think it's sort of a thing.Who are like, I think they're going to try to keep me so I don't know.I'll have to look for another job, butI could stay up worrying about that but there's so many other things and that's something that's really really not in my control.The problem.Is that more I like if I say, I don't want to deal with something.I feel like I just become more of a burden to other people.So it just doesn't look particularly James, but then like things aren't great between us right now, and I just don't want to deal with it.Like it's sort of a new sensation for me or not wanting to just feeling that I just don't have the energy for that.Like I'm not thinking I don't know we have to fix this right away.And I just we didn't we did finally make an appointment with a couples counselor.I think he's going to be able to start like in September.I don't remember his name.His office is the Andover that doesn't narrow down very much.Yes, I'm really glad about that.But that's what I feel.Like there'll be the same thing as like it'll be really good to have done and then we'll have to do it and thenlike that's just how life is it's hard.Yeah, I feel badly because it doesn't seem to me that it can possibly it doesn't seem like it is hard for other people and I realize that like, I don't know other people.I don't realize how hard it is for them.But yeah, I don't think other people want to quit life on a regular basis because they just don'tBecause I just don't because of doing the dishes and it doesn't make me feel like I don't feel like I sort of feel sorry for myself.But more of why can't I just deal with things these normal things.This is just hot like this.Why can I just deal with it?Because I don't think my life is actually harder than most people's.I'm sorry.Yeah, yeah, like I just don't have what I should have to deal with it.I don't know.Salinas and his place where she has her favorite everything for paper cup and and so when the clothes she likes to wear and are clean.She just doesn't want to wear her other clothes and I sort of don't know what to do.I reallyI really know what you're going through is Selena.I really understand on the other hand.You're just going to have towhere these other clothes like just like that's just how it goes.Yeah a little bit.Behind.Yeah, that's all right.I don't remember I mean thinking more generally but I don't remember anyone talking to me about my clothes much.I mean, that's what it feels like anyway.Yeah.Yeah, so are you saying that a lot of my distress at not wanting to deal with my life and having to do with my life and having to deal with my life comes through as I don't know how to resolve that or that I don't know how to resolve that.Sorry.I don't really know what to say except thinking is hard.I'm sorry.I can't stop.Well, I'll lose my train of thought.I think I get to the point where I am trying to sort of take the next step and work things out and I don't know say something intelligent.I I just gets too hard.Yeah.You have a good weekend.Sorry, I'm late.Okay.Oh, okay.I thought 85Okay, and then you'll just send the bill.OU email it to meAnd then I can just bring you in a check.Okay, so it should work out fine.I feel like I haven't seen you in so long.Noel which reminds me this coming Monday I'm going to be at in Ohio and like I won't be back in time, so I just don't want to like take a chance of missing and not being able to be here.So I'll just come next Thursday.Okay.It's been kind of a long week.I'm trying to think so we went to court last week.Madonna Rain on the charges and then the trial starts on March 22nd.So hopefully between now and then we can I guess the goal is to be able to get the charges dismissed.So hopefully but we will see Kevin was here all weekend and he was pretty attached on Friday 12 Thursday night, and I thought okay.Well that seems pretty normal because we're going to court and then after we serve talked and then he kind of just sort of like disappeared almost she was there physically, but just sort of went away and eventually I guess it was early Saturday morning.We were talking and I think he just is really nervous about everything going on.And it keeps saying like he doesn't really know if we're going to be able to it.I guess make things work and he keeps saying that he's trying to sort of keep everything that's happening lately separate not really integrate our relationship into all that stuff.But I'm not sure I'm all I'm feeling a little confused as to what he wants and I don't even think he probably really knows right now because he'll be really distant and then he says like I don't want to fall back into a pattern that we had before I want I want, you know to start over and make things, you know better on one hand.And then on the other hand, you know like Saturday and Sunday, we are together.We went out and we had a good time and we were talking and it was sort of not completely back to normal but in a way it wasSo I feel like how do we keep things separate and not really fall back into a pattern like start over but he keeps saying like, oh, we can't start over until you know, after all the legal stuff is taken care of and I'm just like so I don't even know what is happening right now and he keeps saying like he wants to still see me in like travel back and forth and all these other stuff.So I'm sort of just confused as to what he I guess what his feelings are about everything.And I know that he you know.Falling back into a pattern if you know not talking and not being able to communicate correctly and fighting is definitely not where we want to go.But at the same time it's like if you're trying to keep it separate and then you want to start over or should we be seeing each other now, but he doesn't want to break up.So I'm sort of just like going with it at the moment.And not really sure which new I mean, I tried talking him to stop but he just keep saying I don't know.And I guess you know, he doesn't know maybe he just needs some time to sort of figure that out I guess and he's trying to I think he's just trying really hard to not fall back into pattern what we did before.and sohis way of doing this is whatever he's doing right now.I don't know but I'm supposed to be going there this weekend I leave tonight and you know, I was feeling nervous because I didn't really want the weekend to kind of go how last weekend went where he was just completely detached and almost didn't even talk to me for all all of you know, most of Friday.It was just very awkward and he is I felt really uncomfortable about it.And I sort of just said, you know, I just don't really want to keep that to keep happening if that's how it's going to be every time we see each other.You know, maybe it's better if we just push back and we don't really spend too much time together.So he said he's nervous about this weekend.But he also said like every time we get nervous we can't just be scared and not do anything like we talked about it or something then maybe it will make it a little bit better.I think it feels like I guess what happened.He just keeps saying that doesn't happen in most relationships.Most people don't have this happen.Like this doesn't happen all the time.Like what kind of relationship is this if this is happening, is it even a good relationship?And I guess he's like, I can't focus on pushing back on putting back together a relationship until I can focus on until everything until after I've done focusing on dealing with the whole legal stuff.But now that the arraignment over we sort of have two months where we're just kind of Sitting In Limbo.I mean we can't do anything.We'll talk to our lawyers when we have to but there's not really a whole lot that we can really do and I don't want to thank that like we're just wasting the next two months sort of not moving forward and not really doing anything.You know, I'm coming here and you know, hopefully working stuff out and I was kind of hoping that it would all just sort of coincide.You know like after it happened then yes, okay, we're going to fix it and we're sort of going to move on and as we go and you know, if she wants to start over which in my opinion, I don't think you can really completely start over.Once you sort of have a history someone you can't just start from the very beginning.I mean you can go back and start fixing things that went wrong.But in my mind it's sort of like why isn't that happening now?Like why aren't we fixing it now and working only have communicate and all that other stuff now like what's the point of waiting until later on?Yeah, he's really nervous about having to tell his job and how that could affect, you know, basically how it's all going to affect his career and stuff like that down the line.So I think he's really having a hard time sort of focusing on our relationship right now in like fixing it because he's too concerned about what's going to happen with his career and I think once you know that gets figure it out, then he'll be able to focus better.So, you know I said to him we agreed that we're going to stay together and work through this together.So it's going to take a little time.It's obviously going to take a little time, you know, nothing is ever going to change overnight or not.Just all of a sudden going to become different people and everything is going to work out.but I don't want to start of being the be in limbo in this relationship for a long.Of time, you know, like if March 22nd comesand then we have to go back to court again in two or three months like it is just dragging this out and I right now we're not doing anything to fix our relationship and you know, I know that I need to work on myself personally, but I can do that without being in limbo and serving this weird gray area having a relationship with him because he just I don't even know it like those things like you are always say that he misses me, you know.and I said something to him about it and he's like, well, it's not that I don't but it's sort of my way of keeping things separate feel likeyou will say it or he will say that he loves me and then he won't it's becoming very Hit or Miss I guess.So in like, I don't know what to say to him sometimes like it's appropriate like what's appropriate to talk about or anything like that?And I guess it's time goes on.It will sort of be a little bit easier.But right now it's just very awkward sort of a situation.I understand.I know that it doesn't and when it does it's something something probably has to happen.But the same time I've tried to say to him.I think it happens.I know it happens a lot more than people think.I know that when it's happening to you is to end of the world.And you know, it's really bad, but you know, I try to think like well.This is not like an isolated.You know, it's not like it's never happened before in the entire world.Like we're the only people that this is happened to we can't move on from this.and you know, so I feel likewell, it happened.We're fixing it.So it sucks that it had to happen something so dramatic and so bad for us to finally like the light bulb to go off.But the same time, you know if we're going to stick through it.Then we should probably sort of working on something and I said to him last week.I also go to court and I'm not going to press charges and I'm not going to do anything and we can just sort of not seeing each other and just work on ourselves and revisit the situation at another time and he sort of got us up and he's like are you breaking up with me?You know, what are you saying in like?Well, no, butif that would make it easier for you because he seems to be the only one that struggling with keeping it to separate things.I feel like we should be working on it now, but he doesn't see it that way.Sort sort of we have differences of opinion, but you know, I'm not the only one who's facing legal charges either.I mean maybe if I was and you know,The positions are flipped.I may feel the same way as he like.I can't focus on anything else, but you know whether or not I'm going to have my career that I've worked almost 20 years on and you know all this other stuff.So I'm trying to see it from his point of view and you know, if you are so pathetic then I guess I'm pathetic and taking on his pain and depression.Is it like that?Yeah, he said this morning he feels like he's wakes up depressed and just kind of you know goes about his day and isn't really overly excited by anything when we were talking I said, you know, I usually ask him like how he's feeling and he just says, you know, okay and you know, he's like good isn't really an option right now, but I'm okay I guess but he said this morning he just feeling tired and he's like, I feel like I'm just waking up emotionally drained every day, and that's probably why I'm so tired all the time.It could very very well could be so I'm hoping that he finds a therapist or something.To see down there to just talk instead of get whatever he's feeling off his chest because he's definitely holding on to a lot.Yeah, he keep saying he does but then I feel like sometimes by the time he gets home from work needs to I don't know I guess depressed to feel like looking for someone and I don't want to push it but the same time, you know, I keep asking him like you really need to do something.You really need to go.See someone soon needs like I know I know I know and I can't do it work because they walk all the websites.I have to do it when I get home and blah blah blah blah blah, so I don't know if he's making excuses or not, but I keep asking him, you know, like and saying you really need to go you really need to go and he says he wants toBut a matter of actually going I guess.feeling a little uneasy about the situation and then my mom, of course she saysIt's always something else with her.Thursday night.She texted me and said I don't even know what something about I hope everything goes.Well tomorrow and then Friday morning.She texted me or Saturday morning.She texted me and said I hope everything went well yesterday and then Sunday she check she texted me because she was dropping off my goddaughters gift and she said, you know, I'm going to drop off Madison's gifts.What do you want me to say and I said, well, you don't really have to say anything or do you have to drop off the gifts?And she said oh, well, you won't be home for a while.So I'll just do it and we're going that way so she dropped them off and then my friend who is no longer talking to me because I didn't make it down for my goddaughters 3rd birthday party, and then she stopped talking to me.So it was her birthday present from November and her Christmas present.Just text me and said, you know, thank you.I got the gift.And then my mom texted me again on Monday, so she's like reaching out.But she said, oh I'm going to send a box of stuff that you left here and some stuff that Duffy had left the dog.And I thought maybe you would want them and then I'll send back your suitcase of clothes which was which is like a huge 50 lb suitcase of clothes and she said I think you'll probably need them since you won't be back for a while and I just texted her, you know, thanks for sending the box and you know, you don't need to send the suitcase.I'll come and get it at some point and she just said no problem and I think it in there it was, you know, I really miss you or whatever.But I don't know if you sort of feeling like.I don't know how she's feeling and I know obviously she's trying to reach out but I still feel like I should be standing in a putting my foot down and not like I'm apologizing to her.You know, she can text me and say whatever she wants but that's not good going to change the fact that she hasn't been supportive at all and she can't be and that I don't feel like I can talk to her and you know in the past she's tried to stay to say things and be nice and sort of.Giving in and went back to you know, it's just it's sort of just went back to the way it was before and then she just keeps doing all the same thing.And I don't know and I don't want to give in and I don't want to just ignore the fact that she's been doing all the stuff.Whether she checked she text me or it says and says how much she misses me or whatever.You know, I'm sure she does and that's fine.But the same time it's like a she really misses me.Then why can't you pick up the phone and call to she always just text messages and sends me messages if it mattered that much to hurt him.Why don't then why wouldn't she just pick up the phone and call and leave a voicemail if I don't answer or just take that chance and said she she just sends me a text message because it's easier.I feel like yeah, she's trying to be nice, but it's also sort of just a cop-out because she's just texting.You know, if she ate sincerely cared about wanting to change stuff that I feel like she should be calling me and making a probe laughter and not just sending a text message.It's much easier to do that rather than actually call somebody.Yeah, and so I feel like confused and just sort of I don't really know how I should be acting.and what I should be doing and I definitely with my mom at least, you know, I feel a little bit more like I know whichwhere I want to go with her and then I don't want to go back into having the same crazy relationship and the yelling and the drama and you know, I've already made that decision.And it's sort of a hard decision to make but I can't continue to let her control my life and you know blow everything up when you know, I need her during important times.And so I think as hard as it may be she as she keep sort of text messaging me or whatever.I just have to I guess stay strong and not sort of just let her back in like I normally would do.But you know with my boyfriend, I don't know like I want to work on the things and I want to make them better.But I just what he says and what he does or sometimes two, totally different things and then I'm not sure what I should be doing.and is becoming a little frustrating and you know, I don't know like I even when I try to talk to him is sort ofHe just says the same thing all the time about trying to keep things separate and all that.But I don't know if I need to sort of dig a little deeper and just say like I'm not sure if the skies is if this is going to work or I'm not sure if the says, you know, the sort of approach is okay for the time being, you know.It's not going to like if he doesn't know he doesn't think or he doesn't know I guess.Is what he's saying, you know if he can get over everything that's happened.That's fine.But I feel like he's also not trying to figure out figure that out right now.You sort of just being a depressant sort of wallowing in his own self-pity which for certain.Of time I guess everyone's allowed to do that.But at some point he needs to kind of do something about it make an effort on his part to sort of figure out his feelings and what he wants and all that stuff because I care about him and I love him but I can't wait around forever to figure it out, you know, if this is going to work out or not, so it's sort of frustrating.I just kind of wanted to do something but I don't want to be pushy and you know, I guess everyone has to do it in their own time, you know, I know years ago that I probably should have been here in this room and I just never did so I can't, you know point fingers at him and say like you need to start doing something when it took me years before I finally decided that I needed come.I just don't like being in the story of limbo.Yeah, he says I just didn't know that I had such anger in such feelings inside of me.And he thought that he had sort of given that he had sort of gotten over them.And I think that we've had a few conversations worried.I sort of look back and said, you know, oh, well there were some red flags over the years that you know, I'm now seeing and maybe have indicated that I didn't quite get over everything that happened before and you know, I should have done something about it.But yeah, I guess saw after such a long.Of time that he was just bitter and not really, you know over things.But you know now I think he realizes that he wasn't.And the fact that he still feels that way as sort of a gift scary to him.So I guess it was six maybe seven years ago.He dated a girl when he was living in Maine and she apparently was very interesting and very kind of controlling and didn't you know, I always felt like he was doing something and he was going to hurt her emotionally.And where she would make him open up his email and she would read his email and she would even read through his text messages.And if he mentioned another woman whether she was married single you were really well or didn't know she would freak out and just you know, he's like, I feel like she's just emotionally abused.And there was a lot of different, you know, she said a lot of things to him that were nasty and mean and condescending telling him that he was in a terrible person and all kinds of stuff.And he's like she used to take all kinds of like I think she was on anti-anxiety medication.He said she was taking Xanax and all kinds of stuff and then she would go off of it and she'd go back on it.And then I think they were just a lot of emotional turmoil that happened and I think it was only like 2 years or two and a half years that they were together and eventually he said he was just taking it and taking it and taking and he thought he could help her to fix and fix her and you know, it came to the point where he just couldn't do it anymore like kicked her out, but I don't think he ever really got over the whole situation.Does he still sort of talks about her in a very bitter way and how she, you know did so many things in him and all that stuff.So I kind of know it seemed to me at first like you really wasn't over it, but I didn't realize that it was as bad as it was and he has so much anger and he didn't realize it either.So I guess realizing it as a positive thing and now he's sort of needs to get some help.Needs to get some sort of help with you know, dealing with all of the emotions and feelings that he has sort of.There are related to that so that you know, I guess it doesn't come up again.I think part of him is scared.Like what if it happens again?What it's the same thing happens between him and I that happened a month ago.What if we think everything is fine, and then it happens and I'm like, well, you can't really live in a motive.What-ifs because you can just going to think what if it's going to happen again and then what if what that's what it is, then you're never going to do anything.You're just continuously going.To be sort of scared about everything how everything happens and you know.You sort of take that chance, but you realize you know, I sort a few things and I guess help your own mental status and get your own feelings out.So it doesn't happen again.So, you know.It's not to say who knows.We didn't know it was going to happen it all the first time.You know where?So we're doing everything we can to try and make sure that it doesn't happen again.You don't normally expect that if it's not something that you can predict and say like this is going to happen today.I don't I don't I feel like he really needs somebody to see somebody about it and I sort of felt that way.She has a really bad back.So when he was younger, he was working for a company or something before we went in the military in a refrigerated her going on his back.So we just was in constant pain all the time.And he doesn't want to take any medication for it and he knows all this stuff but you know in the military if he does go to the doctors too much and they say that he has to have spinal fusion or something like that.Then he has toI have a waiver and it's kind of and it kind of messes with his career a little bit.So he's always been nervous to do something but he's always complaining like my back hurts my back hurts and back hurts hurts into me and I'm like, well if it hurts so much then go to the doctor or go somewhere and you know, like do the stretches that you were given to do by your physical therapist or by your doctor from before or go see a different doctor see if you can get the injections are like do something instead of just continuously complaining about it.And I said something start isIn trying to be nice about it, but you know trying to be a little bit firm.and a few months ago and it started resulted in an argument where you know, he was likehe was upset because I was being is not really mean but not necessarily supported or whatever and I was like, but you're always complaining and you're never doing anything about it and it's frustrating when someone on the other end and all they hear you do is complain, you know, I can see you in pain in your visibly like you can't walk sometimes butYou're not really doing anything or trying to help sorcerer.You like the same thing.Why are you saying that he used to do something and he doesn't want it to be this way, but he's not really doing anything right now.It's sort of frustrating me.Yeah, it's just like he complains about stuff, but then he doesn't do anything to like change it.So I'm just like, you know, if you want to pick something then he should probably put some effort into making some serve change no matter what you have to do.So I kind of gave up on asking questions or give you know about us back.It was sort of like I just stop asking questions or stop asking what he could do because he said he just felt like I was being to badgering.but I was in my opinion I just feel likeI was just asking him questions.Like what what can you do?Where can you go?You know, what are your options?And he's like, I just feel like you're being pushy and I was like, okay, I'm sorry, so I haven't really press will going to see a therapist subject the moment but every once in a while I kind of made a comment about it and you know, he's like, I know I know I know but sort of says the same thing about his back so it's going to be coming frustrating.I don't want to just ignore it.But I guess he just needs to do it on his own time or whatever.He wants.I mean, I don't like being told what to do either.But sometimes I feel like I don't really complain all the time without doing something about it.So maybe that's just the way my mom was to me like don't complain about it.And that's sort of how I feel about stuff.Yes, and no means she definitely wasn't like a very lovey kind of person.She was more more of a tough love kind of person.So I guess it's probably a little bit where I get it from.I sort of was just forced to get over stuff or deal with it and not have to let you know.There wasn't like very big emotional conversations.It was it was just sort of like suck it up and move on kind of thing.Primea guess that's my mentality where I just sort of end up sucking things up and moving on and not really.You're not saying anything or you know, just letting people walk all over me and not say anything like no or whatever.I just kind of let it happen.People I work for I usually let them I feel like probably walk all over me with you.No watching the kids and always being home and everything, but actually yesterday that I asked me to watch the kids at night and I plan to go to Yogurt to a yoga class and they always ask me like the morning ofif they can go out that night and is frustrated me ever since I started and I finally got the got the courage to say to her yesterday.Like I don't mind if you go but I would really appreciate if you give me more than you know, like a 12-hour heads-up because I do have things that I would like to do at night when you get home from work and seeing that I'm the one that that's home all day with the kids.You know Wednesdays are half days of school in Wallingford.So they get out of school at noon.So I have them from noon until 6 or 7 when their parents get home.And I finally just said, you know, like if you're going out if you're going to go out, that's fine, but I need you to tell me before I need you to tell me beforehand.The morning ofAnd that was kind of a big deal for me because I'm usually just when it comes to them or a lot of people understand like okay, okay, okay, whatever and I'll probably complain about it or get annoyed and then don't really say anything to them.So finally saying something.Turn trying to you know convey it was.Convey it in sort of a nice way, you know, if you can just give me a little bit of a heads up and she's understanding about and she was like, I'm sorry, I guess that will try and you know plan a little bit better.Send me that was like a big deal.Yeah, I was like she because I think sometimes I'm always so afraid that people are going to be mad or she's going to be upset with me.And so I don't want to say anything to really make waves and I would just sort of let them do whatever they wanted and saying something to her really just saying.Oh no, I understand actually fine.It was kind of a relief for me.Because I didn't expect it.I sort of expected her to be annoyed, but she wasn't she totally understood and I think she does understand that.I have a lot on my plate right now.So if they could be a little bit less, I don't know what shewe're not really pushy, but if they could be a little bit more, you know, I don't know what the Lord would be in blank now.But considering my time, I guess instead of always just considering there'sand you know because they will come home from work whenever they want to and justAnd they only have an hour or two at the kids.Sometimes they go out and sometimes one has a meeting and they leave anyway, so, you know, it's fine, but I would rather them be able to say things.So I did I feel pretty good, but she wasn't annoyed and I wasn't able to say no.Plus I also feel like at this point.I pretty much just lived to always be there.I'm always at the house always do stuff with kids.And you know, I wasn't there on the weekends a lot when Kevin was living in Maine because it was only a 3-hour drive so I could leave but now that he's living so far away.I can't fly there every weekend.And you know when I was there on the weekends, I was always doing stuff with them and always being with them and I'm like, I can't be here all the time because it's making me nuts, you know.Technically, I only work after school Monday through Friday.Like I pick the kids up from school Monday through Friday.And then if one of them one of them has to she always leave you to work at 7:20.But he usually takes the kids to school but he has to go in early or something.Then I'll take the kids to school.Start of the agreement and then I have the weekends myself and I'll go out like once or twice during the week and that's fine.But it's sort of got to the point where you know, if I was there on the weekends they were like, oh, well, we're just going to run to the store.Would you mind watching the kids or we're just going for a walk?Would you mind watching the kids?And since you're home sort of thing.Kind of like they were taking advantage of the fact that I was there and I and that I live there and I don't have anywhere else to go.It's not like I'm leaving and going to my own house.So it sort of was getting really frustrating.And they were taking up all my time and they were taking just clearly taking advantage of me there of me being there and I was getting really frustrated and now I kind of feel like alright.Well if I'm going to have to be here on the weekends, I'm also going to have to start by any other things to do and certified separating myself from always having to do stuff with them and not really feeling obligated that I have toLike I don't have to eat dinner with them and I don't have to.Sit down and have breakfast with them and I don't have to go everywhere and sort of.Do my own thing and hopefully as a happens over the next 6 months, you will make me a little less stressed out and just feeling trapped.Because when you're living and working all the time in the same house.And then on the weekends are not really getting a reprieve from the same people in your just with them seven days a week and I'm with the kids, you know, seven days a week.And you know a normal job, but I would have my weekends free and there was a lot of times that even when I was in Maine, they sort of didn't really respected the fact that I was away and they would you know, they wouldn't call so much but you know, they send me emails and one time there's a snowstorm.I think it was back in November or something, or maybe it was October.There was the hurricaneand I was up in Maine and they're like, you know kids don't have school, but theyemailed me Eric.In the morning and said, can you be home by noon?And it's a three and a half hour drive for me.So IFinally crawling was like no, I can't be home until noon because this you know 8 in the morning or asking me to be home in like 3 hours or you know know on the way.and it's just likelittle stuff thatthat I didn't I don't even think they pay much mind to.Is your sweater?Yeah, whatever.But to me, I'm like your started invading my personal space I guess.My mom's always done that.She never really gives me a break and I just want to have some time to myself.And they kind of are always just taking advantage of stuff and it gets really frustrating and they don't I think unless I say something and I'm like I did yesterday about not asking the day of about watching the kids.The probably won't ever really change.So I feel like now I have to sort of do things and not be around so much.I don't really think that they care but it's like to them if I'm there then.What's the difference?So there's sort of like a little lack of respect in the whole boundary situation.So that sort of adds to some of my stress being there all the time and not being able to sort of get out.Hopefully I'll be able.To be a little bit more assertive about my own time on the weekends if I'm going to be there.And that should help.Right, and I sort of as I was thinking like, you know, I let them because I don't say no and I don't want to upset them by saying no or you know, anything like that.So they're not intentionally trying to take advantage of me, but they are.And so it does, you know, it works both ways, you know, I'm sort of allowed them to do it.And they just going to continue to do it whether there.Go to singer.So even though this is my last sort of six months there.I feel like I'm going to have to really start putting my foot down over the next 6 months or I'm going to go crazy.Being there all the time.It's just a lot never having a break especially with the kids because they don't really have There's No Boundaries and when their parents come home and they started.And they can sort of leave me alone.And I don't mind a thing.It's justI constantly ask all of us for stuff when you know.Yeah, there's not really any separation.I sort of become less like the nanny more just part of the family.So, you know when we go places she doesn't even like introduce me as a nanny.She's like I was just feel like still so bad introducing you like that because I feel like you're more of like family.I'm just like, oh, okay.That's fine.That's great.But you know when it comes to things like having boundaries and separation and giving me my own personal space.When I needed it, especially when I'm there all the time.Oh boy.Okay.Yeah, that's fine.at 10 after 1Okay.Yeah, we need to do if we need to explain.Yep, absolutely.Oh, no, no.No, I usually would be here on time.But today I got a late start.But yeah, that's fine.Okay, great.Thank you.Thank you.ElsaI was just walking around.I was just thinking about sorry.I hope it doesn't bother you when I crack.Sometimes people get.I was just thinking about how you were saying or you said a number of times.It's no longer about on any particular week or month or whatever whether I'm depressed or whether I'm feeling anxious or better today.I was really thinking about that.I was really kind of sitting with that feeling and it's absolutely true.I was like wow, that's why I feel kind of wacky because when I just stopped and I just kind of scan how I feel I don't feel good or bad.I'm just I just am know what I mean.And I think that's it's odd.Yes, and I'm feeling for me.I noticed a little thing.That was when I stopped at the cafe.This girl came in it was super pretty and I thought I remember how I told you before if I see someone super pretty whoever who especially if they seemed like they were kind of my type or whatever.That can instead of just beat me like, oh, wow.Look at that beautiful girl.I can be like a whole like I just feel down and you know what, I mean?I noticed on now that doesn't that just doesn't happen or even if it does happen is not part of me.You know what I mean?It just pops up and it just kind of sits like she got her coffee.Smiley smiley.We smiled at each other as she left and I was like, all right, you know what?I mean?I noticed that so there's that thing if I won't go down that road I can so it's just an interesting how it'sWes unless what?Wait a second.What's the difference between that and egocentric?So it's a good thing orI see.Take some notes fact.That's an amazing word.OSHuh?Okay.Got it, whatever in a might be.Got it.Yeah.Yeah.and I'm still so this is whatOh, he got it.So these things that what I just talked about that, okay, so that'sego-dystonicBut it's not really who I am.Yeah.Right.Those are like the voices and thoughts has more of your environment.And your context that don't really have anything to do with you with who you your sense of who you are got it.That's awesome.Okay.Yeah.No, I want to know what those words.That's awesome.Yeah, because even I was walking around and it's not that I don't feel Melancholy.Yeah, because I think I do like yeah, why am I?Why?Have I been able to accomplish a lot of other things but I can't and haven't why haven't I chose?Why haven't I had one relationship that I can get that I can point to and say yeah, that was exactly the kind of girl.I wanted or very close to the kind of girl I wanted.And she lived around here and you know what?I mean, and it was just all just nice.We just dated even if it doesn't work out we did and it was nice and she was my girlfriend.You know what I mean?I don't get that about that's that is a mystery to me still.I mean I get what some of the factors might be.But I guess what I'm saying though is even when that kind of bums.We out I'm walking around I feel melancholic about it, but I don't yet doesn't change the consistency of my days.You know what I mean?How old I am daily, you know what I mean, which is amazing, but I can also see how that's kind of unsettling because then I have all the space in my mind.Yeah, I've I was just reading I always go back to this Julia kristeva book about have you read this?depression and melancholyOkay, but anyway, anyhow, she's French so half the time who the fuck knows what she saying, but I don't I did notice that though.I was reading some sentences and I do have trouble.I still have trouble kind of concentrating or focusing in the moment.But less so so there were some sentences where I was like, oh, I think I know exactly what the sentence is what the sentence means that's a good thing instead of just reading it and being like wait.What?What did I just read?I don't know what I'm reading.Is getting a little better with stuff like this.That before I beat you like I just have no idea what's going on here.I don't know what these words are.I don't even get the and I even have moments where I can't follow their grammatical structure of the sentence, which is really disconcerting.Now I don't get upset about that and just like I just I'm like fine just keep going don't stop and get all stressed about what that and then eventually I picked up once and then I really get it.Yeah, that's true.But you know how it is if you're both an artist and you've also been in school and thenGrad school and then I mean, you know how people talk about the shit is if they some of them are Faking It.Right now I'm with you but still if you're someone that's like me that's really intimidating.Then it makes you feel shity that you don't how come you can't talk about things like that or even if they're pretending why am I not able to read that or and then just pretend some sort of pretend.I'm very intimidating articulation about that or something.You know what?I mean?I'm just not it's not in me that's once into is I just I mean then there are people who do have substantive.Things to say about stuff that they read and I think I'm in that camp and it just bothers me or it has bothered meme.When I just feel like I'm glazing over.Because I know that some of that is definitely yeah, you're totally right.Who knows what the hell they're talking about, but some of that also, I think it is just my situation.When there so much static constantly just your being aroused by negative thoughts and this worries and whatever even reading Danielle Steel would probably be dead.Probably forget the paragraph.I just read there is a lot of that sometime sometimes I do get what I'm reading.yeah but I'm just forgetting immediately I can't retain information so that's gotten better butyeah I know I don't care so much like this book I don't care what I'm reading itI slept through it I just read different chapters and go back to beginning and their read that again who cares it was passed I was just very dogmatic and hard myself.That shit like no you pick it up and you read and you make notes andYeah, I feel like I feel.I was really hard on myself.But again, it's because I projected I assumed I imagine that there are other people who get these things and they make little notes.What are these notes that they're making?What's the what are the insights are happening when they read things and yeah, it was reallywrite that again.Yeah, but you know what?I mean, it's like with everything else written music just sent projection that I always have some even though whyare doing it better or they're more together or they're the real thing or is there something I don't know what how to describe it.But yeah, I have a great band and I'm a good songwriter, but somehow I'm not cool enough or I'm not whatever that thing is that I'm perceiving that other people haveBut now I know it's just exactly that.It's just what I'm projecting or thinking that I perceive it just another way to kind of put yourself down or just think you're last in other people.So yeah now that it it don't feelThat is my just much easier.Now.I just pick up a book and who gives a shit.I just want to read a couple pages of us and I'm done.I don't have to write a paper about it.So.exactlyAre they even if I read it from cover to cover or not caring whether I have made your insights about whether I get everything she's talking about or so, but yeah, I think just in general.That's the bag.Yeah, I really kind of yeah.Today, I was just sort of walking around just kind of feeling the feeling of not having extreme feelings.It was justinterestingYeah, just yeah, it's very yeah, it's just so new.It's like I don't ya I guess it's it is disorienting.Right.Yeah.Right.What if they're just regular at the end of the day?They're just people.Right.That's true.Yeah, well, I think that a lot of times when I read this and like it's just this typical French.I think there's something there but I bet you could say it in 10 pages.Yeah, but I mean at the end of the day all the stuff is now it's about time doing something constructive with you know what I mean?I think that's the next step is be more productive day in and day out because I'm still not but it's much better butI mean, that's why I'm really glad I did this.I feel really nervous about the business.But see now.I was just washing my hands down.I said only just remembered.Oh, I have an offer andThe good thing now, it's fucking real.You know what?I mean?I can't be talking about.Yeah, I wonder how I'm going to Market going to Market to it doesn't matter.It's just got to get done.I need to figure things out.Embassy them and do them and so that's a good feeling.That's a really good feeling and if nothing else I'll have those box of time in a beautiful office to gather my thoughts and write or read or study for being a life coach or doing my maybe whatever.I don't know.I was like maybe I should just take ice just start taking you some psychology courses anyway.I mean I could just go to UMass or whatever and just take some courses are online.It's so easy now.But anyway that are is this.Things are getting a little more.I'm forcing things to get more structured and you know what, I mean?But that's a big part of it too.When you have time to be scanning how you feel and think all the time that's not good.Yeah, exactly.So you need some kind of I mean, I want the flexibility.I want whatever whatever.But the reason I want all this.I wantall that is so I can have the kind of structure.I want it's not that I don't want structure work, you know, you know what I mean?But so now it's time to an act that put things together put that together.MondayI mean, I guess it could you know, I meanI guess I could have just used yesterday.I haven't Mondays and Wednesdays 12 to 4.But yeah.I could have used it Wednesday.I'm pretty sure yeah.Wait, what?Oh, yeah, Wednesday, right?Today's Friday.Sorry.Yeah, I suppose I could have yeah, but yeah, so Monday I'll just go and start kind of figuring out what it's like what the deal is andThey do it by blocks 12 to 4 Mondays and Wednesdays.Which is why I had to move fast.They had other I mean, I think that's a pretty good.It seems to be a lot of time that people want.I had a feeling no one wants to see life coach at 9 a.m. Or I mean, I don't know.I think later in the days.I mean I still worry a little bit.I don't let people what about everybody that's working 9 to 5 or whatever.Things like that, whatever but whatever me and obviously I'm here people are here seeing therapist or whatever.So but yeah, and then I wonder where I don't know if there's flexibility with that once you get going or I don't know.I don't know how that works, butYeah, I mean if I had some clients.Where they were like I can I really can only come at this time at that point.I had to figure out what the deal is butNot right now, but yeah at some point if it did then because right now it's all open so I could just tell someone to come at 2 or 3 or 4 or whatever.But oh, that's the other thing.I don't know just woke before mean the last client like you need to be out by 4.It does right for our block.Okay, that's what I thought.Right.Okay.Ohyeah.That's interesting.So wait.12 to 1 1 2 2 and o no you can still see.Our people but chances are you know, I mean, I'd have to have people conflicting.I mean, I don't have that problem at some point.But yeah, that's I mean, I'm a dumbass about take advantage.You know what I mean?if I'm not there at leastwriting reading working out of business, you know what I mean?That could be my time to just see even that instead of constantly if you don't have something structured and you can always be thinking about it or not.That's why I'm like, alright welluntil I have the clients.Those hours are for business marketing Network email people.I don't know whatever.Probably.Yeah, I mean it's right here.Yeah, that's well, that's okay.I mean, that's okay for now.It's but yeah, I mean, yeah, it's it gives me that are even with the writing.You know what I mean?Okay, I'm going to work on a business little bit.Then I'm going to Thursday's no excuse now, you know what?I mean?It's a beautiful place peace and quiet nice Sunday Byron place is on me now.So I think thatSo I think that's I could tell I needed something like that to kind of.You need a good kind of pressure.I don't think anything.No, I mean I'll be looking forward to it.Yeah, you didn't go Wednesday and wondered why?Well, Wednesday was a day I get bleach them.I feel like I could be kind of weird like your Solis.I'm going upstairs.So yeah.Definitely has to figure out the marketing thing.Sono, it's you can't just be sending out emails hoping to get clients or whatever.I got to figure out a way to be more specific kind of marketing.I was just thinking about Cecilia.and I was thinkingtoday was kind of chilly in the morning even little things like when I wake up.She has a habit of at least every other day when I wake up.I feel her I mean is just ridiculously cute.I sleep on my side.And I will literally kill her crunched up and mashed in as part of me like this.It's like we're expanding.And I was thinking about that.I was like that.even though is I almost don't know what toDo with it.If so every time it happens I can't today was.and she also kind of took some up some of the blanket so I was pretty cold and I was not but I didn't want toI don't want to scare her away or get her off to ped.Sorry, just laying there but even stuff like that is I'm just not used to it still.It's just beautiful.It's like now I get it animals are you're not really human until you can you can connect with a pet.It's just unconditional love and it's so peaceful and sweet.It's just an amazing thing.Right.Yeah, it's very sweet yet.And then when she does get out, she'll come up and she'll justThey just know not to scratch you or so.She just puts her paw.So just go like this ER.She doesn't know my head or is she looks a pillow right next to me is that's just crazy.It's such a beautiful thing.She somehow knows.Okay, I'm not going to use my class for this one.It's so amazing.Yeah, I mean ragdolls are like that anyway, but thenWhen they do get attached to their owners, I think it's more like they're just very affectionate.Yeah.I mean it's crazy.But now I can see I'm a crazy need Riser here.Especially someone like that.He's a lunatic now I get why his cat is his best friend.I mean because he's so fucked up but it's I'm not comparing me but I see why people who don't have friends you don't have inside but at least there's comfort in about a creature with you depends on you and whoThat's right.Yeah, I exactlyIt's interesting.I was thinking about we have a show coming up and it's a good bill, but I think because of the way I've been feeling.I almost don't care that much.It's a weird feeling.It's not that I'm looking forward that I'm not looking forward to it.It's just kind of I don't find myself kind of way used to I care about making music releasing whatever but I just don't care.About the shows as much I guess.I don't know.Yeah, it's not extreme.Yeah, not like I don't know ya.No, not at all.Exactly.Yeah, right.It's just kind of like oh, yeah, we're going to play the show.I almost don't know how I'm supposed to feel you know what I mean?Maybe that's why I had a weird what seems like a panic attack at the outdoor show.It was just kind of like I feel confident.I'm fine and yet I feel weird like maybe I'm not used to the way I'm feelingI don't know what the fuck it was but everything was right on everything sound right everything.I don't know.Maybe that's why I guess maybe I was anxious because I wasn't anxious or something.I don't know.what I feltit felt nice.I mean just the weather is nice.I was just and I was just aware of the fact that I was fine.That was basically I was like, it's a beautiful day.I'm fine.I can't think of anything.That's really I'm not depressed whatever but I also don't feel amazing.You know what I mean?Or I pick something like I do feel really lonely, but somehow it's notIt's just their I'm not it's not affecting me and some.It's not stopping me from also feeling pretty good.You know what I mean?So yeah, I was just kind of likeI get a little more anxious care.Yeah because of Iright.Yeah, I do not anxious.But yeah, I do feel more a little more jittery or like I'm not sure.Yeah.Exactly.Yeah.Am I going to be repeating myself or I don't know.Yeah, not repeating.But you know what, I mean.Just picking seems like I'm only or what or am I just going to be talking about how to grow the business or you know what?I mean?I yeah, I don't know.Yeah.Unless maybe exactly it in a way though.Seems lead to deeper.feeling sexualI think it's partly about yeah, but it's partly.I may be more.That I just when you're so used to extremes it's almost like I don't even know what I'm thinking about anyway.I yeah, I guess I feel lonely.But yeah, I don't know, you know what I mean?So that's why I'm saying maybe that is for at least maybe to be like yeah, I'm not sure if I feel that lonely right now, but let's talk about loneliness.You know what I mean?Because then that does lead toand I think that's kind of the whole point now coming here.What about today?I feel like shit or yesterday is someone looked at me funny or whatever the fuck I feel or I feel amazing.They're not these extreme things that have to be worked out or whatever.They're just now.It's a much more.I don't know.It's a much more nuanced kind of thing.Yeah, right.Right exactly.Yeah, I mean it's all in either problems or inflated kind of euphoric kind of stuff.You know what I mean?So but yeah mostly problems, so whereYeah, right.It's not grounded.Yeah, it's not stable.If nothing else I've just been used to really high state of anxiety all the time.Get her bad now.It's like yeah last week the last few weeks now I feelI think that I did.Do I did this?I feel Whatever anxiety I feel now is anchored to something.It's like well, yeah, I know shit.I mean I just signed at least.So now it's about work in that kind of wears before last week.I felt abstract and more Amor existential anxiety of I'm doing what am I doing?I think it's when you anchor things into either released or whatever a job or whatever it is and you can feel anxious but there's comfort in the fact that there's a concrete thing that you're thinking about.What's my point?But yeah.But in general, yeah, I just I just don't feel the same level of bond stop anxiety all the time.So yeah, it's just kind ofit's like emotional Superstar me and fucked up and that's just the way that your stew and then suddenly if it's calm and there's beautiful sunlight and you're like, holy shit like at all the stuff in the water, you know what I mean?Have a good one.I'm going to write that down.Suddenly.You're like there's a whole world in the water.Forget what's going on up here.So that'sExactly.Yeah survive or thinking that well, this is just it this is just the weather.It's not a storm.It's just so it's a perfect metaphor.That's the one it's even better than the Makoma one.Because then it's like not only star world into the water.But even though it's beautiful thing.You're still kind of scared you might fall in.You know what I mean?You're like shit.I don't know if I'm that good that good of a swimmer or what if some of the stuff down there certain things look beautiful, but they're really not or what are some of them look awful, but they're notthey're just all different creatures are just all different things.Yeah, it's weird.Sometimes I sit here and there is nothing that really comes up.It's strange or maybe there are but I can't what's the word?I can't my mind doesn't latch onto anything.I'm just kind of I don't know just it's weird.It's so strange and it's emotionally neutral or something.Yeah, that's awesome.Those things that gives kids on their arms.Yep, that's awesome.my little gogglesYep.who isare you serious?Well, no kidding.It's funny because I wonder if subconsciously because that's one thing I have I have I love watching documentaries and stuff.But yeah, something feels really claustrophobic to me about that.But even the pressure that builds and I don't know if there's something about that that's very claustrophobic.But now I wonder if subconsciously it's also about what I was saying.Yeah what we were talking about.That's funny your scoobert.You're a scuba.You're like a little josquin stole.That's awesome.What's that?O on the side, of course, that's awesome.Yeah, I guess when you think about it, it's not.I mean, what's the fear really?It's your oxygen tank.You're down there with the critters, and I don't know butYeah, I think that yeah.yeah, for other people it's likeit's being confined in a small space or whatever.But yeah for me it's those two extremes either being really high up or being way below.I mean I can go to the top of a building, but I don't really want to go to the edge or I get freaked out of people get to close.I don't get freaked out.But internally I start getting really nervous when people get too close to Edge the last interesting.Yeah, that's awesome.Yeah, exactly.I'll just go to the store and get those slippers and stuff get the ones that have dinosaurs on them and stuff.What's up?Oh you meanoh, no, I yeah, I know that one of those things were until actually I know that was a big difference butYeah, yeah, it's emotional.It's I know that I feel really self-conscious.Just said I'm one of those dudes that plays on the it would take me a while to now I'm one of those not that it's that's a bad thing.But I've had so much skepticism over the years.I don't know.or things are such a pitch sometimes butyeah, I it's just all the all these little things.I mean a lot of it is just superficial.All of it.I think is just superficial for the most part butYeah, no, I mean my excuses or superficial.I think ultimately it's just I don't know what I would say or how it's going to feel orOr what if somehow changes our drink our dynamic or something?I don't know why it would butIt says yeah.It's like I'm afraid if it feels right don't fuk with it.You know what I mean?It took so long to get to this point.I'm just kind of like oh, this is nice.SoI know right exactly yet.That's true.Yeah, but I guess now that I'm thinking about it.It's extreme.For example, I justI just now for some reason I just now saw it.What if I was on the couch one day?What is that?It's not like I have to come in and pee on the couch every day.I mean I could just come and be like, you know what I don't feel like it today.I just want to sit with.It's weird.I hadn't really thought about you know what I mean, I think of these.Yeah, I think of these things are so something.I don't know what I think of it as but yeah, I just like diving I mean you dive and then you come back up.You don't maybe you don't want to die tomorrow.Whatever it is.I meanis Cyrus circling?Yeah, I just look at the top and tropical fish for a while.Alright.Thank you.I've been weekend.See you next week.You can turn that thing on if you want.It's a little chilly.How's it going?Oh man.Well, so yeah a lot going on.Yeah, I definitely like a situational depression thing maybe a little bit.I don't know justbeen a little bit of a roller coaster last several days even like within the same day like sometimes yeah, I'm having so that's right.Yeah.Yeah Thanksgiving was okay.I mean, you know.I was glad that we did at my cousin's for reasons I said so I didn't hear one political discussion the whole night, you know, but yeah.You know where our families gotten.Just gotten depressing, you know, like there are no women kind of you know Ulysses is a shell of his former self is nothing to talk about really except his stuff.I just yeah, I don't know it was okay.But there was something something about a little I don't want to say pathetic but something was just kind of felt kind of very blah.It was fun to hang out with my little cousins or whatever.But Friday was really nice.I haven't hung out with George.We went to see Peter Wolf.That was nice, you know, it was a fun night via.I don't know just in general.I'm kind of everyday is like a I don't know how it's going on.I'd go any more kind of, you know, just because I'm soAre so many things going on I think yesterday and the day before I really had moments were.I really felt like dark depressed kind of and I realized part of it is because you know, I've just I realize in those moments more than I have before.Thought you know how sucked up these old things and are and me like my mom's voice.So I think now thatI'm so much better.And so many ways when I have those moments for some reason Iget even it's a really bad momentary.Because I just feel like wow, I must hate myself so much, right?I must have so much.I mean I don't hate myself, but those figures are there.You know what I mean?Iauntlike I just get so bad and so likeThe other night I will.There were also some other like real things that happened but those were really just like I was even down I couldn't even step back to see how will I handle?You know what I mean?Like that's even happening right now.I'm handling things so well, but I have trouble seeing that you know what I mean, and that's depressing.You know what?I'm saying that I don't find Comfort sometimes in that or I don't I don't know if I'm explaining it well, butYeah, yeah.Yeah.yeah, yeah, because I thinkWhat it is is I think I mean a lot of people experience that I just think that what it is is that if you're an artist in your Ambitions in serious about more than one art form, I mean in other words, I already have so much on my plate that could cause all kinds of melancholy and frustration, you know what I mean?So then when you going to have a coupleso then when you couple it withAll this old stuff.That's hard plus feeling lonely.Like I'm having a moment where I justfeel really lonely like in frustrated.And then it becomes like a vicious cycle, you know, and then I'm going to make you know, that's just not going to happen and not going to find blah blah blah.I don't want to find someone.Assyrian, but how the stock that's going to happen.I want to go to Assyria.But I don't have the money to do that right now.So time is just going by you know what I mean?It just becomes like athe two things that happen though.I did date Sunday night or Saturday night and that I was that I was really looking forward to like this girl was kind of getting butterflies a little bit.Wish that doesn't happen often anymore at all.So we have a great time we go hang out.She has a drink whatever fine.Okay hang out.We had a great time at the end of the night.I walkedher kind of halfway home and we make out whatever whatever it the next day or the day after I got an email saying that she doesn't feel comfortable with drinking and driving and for that reason it's justIt's just going to work.We can't hang out together.Now it's just like so it got me on so many levels.First of all that sounds like bullshit to me.It just don't say anything.Like if you're just like if you're just not in into it or something.It don't say anything just be a guy about it.Don't I prefer that?Don't give me some weird.I don't like the whole Your Grace you're so awesome.Obviously, I'm not that great in that awesome, you know, but second of all.I was like drinking and what the fuck are you talking about?Yeah, it's just I mean that's already obviously sore spot with me.And I was like what so I wrote back to her.I was like, I'm sorry, but I don't who is drinking and driving?I walked you halfway home and then I went what do you mean drinking and driving?and like to two and a half years, but I said on top ofall that I told you I was totally fine.If you don't drink like I asked you like I'm totally flexible.We can just have tea.No, she just told me that.You're that uncomfortable.And also, why do we have such a great time?And why do we make out like, what the fuck are you talking about?You know what really got me was a part of the conversation that night.She had this whole thing about when we talk about relationships.And I never even heard this term gaslighting.I don't even know what that was, but she was talking about and she was like, oh my God, that's I didn't know there was a word for that, but that's what happened to me like twice.Gaslightlike what Samantha did to me is gas-lighting?where I make you feel like you're crazy and irrational like you're the one being weird, you know, she gives me this wholeThing about that and then she sends me this.I was like dude, that's the ultimate you're doing.The thing that you said, you don't like it doesn't.Don't make any fucking sense, so.I was just like that didn't help.You know, I was like, of course that one girl.I kind of got all you know like that just that was a good becausethen that put me in a bad, you know, I was like Seether Something There the girls I really want.There's something about me that you don't like me.Like there's something you know, that was fat.That was bad.In the next day this girl that I have been kind of seeing but it's not we haven't talked about any exclusive nothing nothing but one time she was on our second date.She let it slip that she been on another okay stupid date, but I kind of told her I was like, you know, I don't I'm a very don't ask don't tell guy there's no reason like I'm I supposed to be what's the reason to do?to do for melike we're on a date so I don't really want to know but anyway, she had emailed me Sunday and she was she was like she sent me this long email saying, you know is online dating thing is probably it's kind of crazy.I just bought with Y and then she's like, you know, basically I stopped with someone last night and she's like, I just feel really bad.I know that you don't have the sleep don't ask don't tell thing but I just feel like I have to tell you and she was like, I totally understand if you don't want to see me or whatever we had plans that night.That's what it was.She was like, you know, I still really like to see you but she's like it just happened.I totally didn't blah blah blah all the stuff whatever.You know what?It's not it's not I wrote back such a great response to her.I wish.I could read it to you.But because it's got me thinking about this whole day and how in a way my response to her and calculated it forced me to crystalize what I think about day and I just told her I was like, you know, I'm not sure how to respond.I mean to us.This is the whole problem with online dating.It's a problem with dating General.I told her I was like we all say we want a certain thing but everything we do.in the ways we try to get those things are totally antithetical to that and I was like, you know, this is why we don't like goingI mean, yes, I was I'm on there too, but it's like but it's why but I hate being on there and I'm super super picky about who I actually meet and it's just like we're flipping.It's like shopping.I mean, we all pretend that we're reading profile profile.We're not religious.He's attractive.He's not he's a track if you know what I mean, she's attractive.That's all it is through something.That can't be healthy.There's something that can't be healthy.It just can't.Something doesn't feel healthy.Yes.I know you could walk into a bar and that's what you need.What you do, too, but there's something humane.Yeah, I mean what people are doing match.com.Come on.Yeah, of course, there's a profile but you don't really pay attention to that profile unless you already decided someone's really attracted to you.Yeah, that's what I'm saying.What do you mean?No, no, no.Oh, no, no, no.No, I'm just saying for everybody.I'm saying at the end of the day what?Yes.Yeah, and what and what I'm saying is that the internet has really boil down to a pretty harsh level.You know what I mean?So just flipping you can literally flip you don't like them flip select.You don't like them to the right.I mean that can't be helping you know what I mean?And it's not about who's the most attractive just in general for all of us, you know.So I was like, you know, but then you need someone in the problem is I know that you're on there right and you know that I'm on there.So what we're supposed to do on the second date, we're supposed to be like, okay, so no more OkCupid this is it like we're going to write no but then so but now you slept with somebody and you're telling me and I was like, how can I see you tonight?Yeah, yeah, except I mean but she was totally cool and away.She was wholly likeShe was like, you know.when I responded she was like I totally understand like she was like she was likeIf it was me, I'd be pissed.She's like I can't believe you're not more angry or whatever, but I appreciate whatever.I don't know but basically all I said was I think I handled it.I guess this is what I'm saying.Like I handled it really well, but it's so depressing, you know.It says rainforest.I was like well see you this is why this is why I don't do ya.Let's say she hadn't told me but she still did sleep with another dude.Just like I don't I was like I'm working hard to not be retarded not be more cynical as cynical and jaded not jaded, butjust try to trust people more know butJust you know things like that don't help especially coupled with the night before this other chick giving me this weird.It's just all this time.Like what am I doing?It's like you can't win us what I what I was telling I was like, I feel like what dating you can't roll anymore.It's either going to be the love of your life who you marry.I mean, either you're going to get married to this person or I justfeel like there's a lot of we're all we're just all so fucked up and I don't know.But I mean that was part of my I mean, you know, but I was proud for not being so angry and somehow it didn't this weird her telling me she slept with this.Other person did I use bad as the night before because it was just honest.And also she was like I want to see you if she's like I messed up and she's like I'm but she was so honest.She she was likeI'm really great at the few dates first few days.And then she's like, I'm just not that great.She's like, you know, I just have some things I got to work on.She's like, you know, I haven't been single very often.Like I just don't know how to do this very well and Wobbles and blah blah.I mean it was at least honest, you know, but the night before that just felt Samantha ask that's what surprised me, you know, but yeah coupled together plus all the other bigger broad, you know wanting an Assyrian chick boom has in Delaware what happened with that?That's far away.Do you know what I mean, but she can San Diego, you know, just like I don't know.I signed it all depressing.I just don't know how to.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I know right?Yeah, I do.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, that's a separate thing.Yeah.Yeah Yeah Yeahs last night you my called me actually we were texting and I just told her it was like yeah, I'm okay but I just really out of blah blah blah and she called me you know, and I was like I have troubleAnd yeah, I have trouble and I told her I was like, you know, it's hard like this is hard.I was like I've gotten so much better, but I just yeah I got these old these triggers happening like I'm complaining and weak.Yeah, I just I suddenly really get anxious and I'm just down to like involve my fucking problems and I can't suck it up and be tough.Yes.Yeah, specially the women.Yeah, maybe that's why that happens in here.I never thought about that.I mean not that obviously, you know what I mean?I never thought about that one particular thing that when I talk to women I get anxious even women.I'm not involved with regardless.You cannot be involved with someone but you have a certain image of them.So then I always feel likeI don't seem as manly to this woman.And I don't seem as attractive and kind of funeral.Even if she's a doctor.Yeah, I think that's what happens because my dude friends I can talk about it a little bit and then it feels more like venting and I just am I and I can just something you know, it's not quite but yeah with women I get flustered.I feel like I'm not articulate and then I'm going to I'm just going on and on it kind of makes it worse.my momWell, that's I came up with that because I hate it so much when they complaining and I think that's so unattractive that couple.Dark couple that with the making me feel like I'm not attractive register that so then put those together and you know, it just becomes an assumption that complaining is very unattractive.It's stupid.Annoying annoying right because I have no patience for their complaining.So I'll just started assuming that as I am that okay this person doesn't they have their own problems.They don't want to okay.Yes.It's hard.They you know, like another words.But there's a finite very brief window of actually of actual real sympathy or whatever, but then you got to move it along, you know.Yeah.Yeah, I think that's basically impossible in my mind.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, I'll start feeling like oh, you know, well, it's your job, you know, or like I'll think know Claire does really care but it's also her job or you know what I mean?I'll couple the really caring with someone else like while you know, yeah.No, no.No I'm saying.I'll say she does really care, but it's also her job.It just means like if we were just friends that yes, you really do care, but now at some point you'd be like, alright.Well, you know, what am I having for dinner or even worse?I mean the dog is place my mind goes.You're like, you know, thank God my boyfriend's not like this.You know what?I mean?Yeah, I think it's so funny when you say I'm in.In my mind, it's almost it's become like a bit of a game like wow then.When Clara says we're all the fucking psychologist is saying that's some hardcore shit.Oh, I'm not saying that it's what you're thinking.here, I don't go quiet there, you know, butIf this wasn't here, oh, yeah.Yeah if I was going on and on like this immediately, yeah, my mind will go like I'm sure her husband is yeah, there's probably something bad about him.He just tougher than me use, you know what I mean?Like all just it's bad.That's a bad place to go.Yeah.Yeah.Police officer to I'm sorry, go ahead.It's also the opposite right?I mean, I'm actually just making it this connection now, but I can't believe I didn't think of it before but it's also the inverse.Why can't I get that's one reason that's one side, but then I have trouble also listen to girlfriend still make it right.Because then I start projecting little bit like she's getting a little complaining out, you know.and that's not fair either butI do that because I think I'm I immediately get like us a good relationship going to be a lot of like talking to me for an hour everyday about our fucking job and has a bitch the girl who sits next to her as such a bad as you know what I mean.So I have a low tolerance like I don't know.I think it's because I can't sometimes I forget there's difference between just whining.And just talking about real problems not just some asshole at work like going on and on about that, but you know what we're talking about here emotional like real kind of course things not just someone cut you off on the road and you're going on and on about how pissed off you are, you know?Yeah.rightPlus in the Assyrian Community, that'sI hate to say yeah, I'm not trying to generalize but you know the women tend to be kind of fucking shrill and chatterboxes and them intend to be so occur.funny guy kind of type guysYeah.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.But yeah, it's depressing.Well, I was just thinking like wow that just adds.I mean, I see it so clearly now like see that I'm also not good at listening and you know, I'll listen but then like shut inside I'll be kind of shut down after a certain point.I'm like, all right.Yes again wrap it up.You know, that's not good either, you know, so that I'm so I'm atYeah, that's what I'm saying.Yeah, that's that's what I'm saying because I'm forgetting the part about whoever that person is and yes, they are venting but this is totally different.They're seeing me.Yeah, well the ones I'm thinking of specifically they saw me.I mean, you know even Tara, you know, yeah, she was kind of fucked up.But I mean she you know, she love me.I mean she you know, that was you know, she did.It was you know again kind of a Meredith thing.Like maybe I was going to work out long like maybe it wasn't going to work out long-term.But I mean she you knowOh, absolutely God.Yeah.Yeah, I mean most of the time.I kind of did to be honest with you.I mean, there's been very few where I didn't feel like I was you know.Yeah.Yeah.Got it makes me sick.It's just like I've already been feeling kind of headache you the last two days.So it's just like yeah because it's just overwhelming, you know, it's like and this is the other thing when I have these feelings lately.I'm like, wow, it's not going to change tomorrow.So it's hard to not letMake it worse, you know what I mean?That's also that also fat.Almost makes it worse that I don't like time is just March along and I'm so trying to work the shit out.I know I've gotten so much better.I have to remind myself of that because it's just frustrating.and thenWith all the snow yesterday.I started recording an EP and it's like last night.I was thinking what see this I can't take it.Like I just wrote this song over the weekend.Okay, I don't have lyrics yet.I went to the coffee shop yesterday.I was some of the best lyrics I've I've ever written I think.In Like A 1 hour.Shut up to the space recorder rap version.That sounds fucking amazing.These guys had never heard the song before and yet I can't you know what I mean?And you know all this is happening.You know what I'm saying?Like that's just I'm losing patience with my so you know andThat I don't know how to get out of that.It's become such athat to me feels like a broken record.Just like, you know just not being able to talk and relax a little bit.Like wow, what a great productive.You know what I mean?I can't like I'm worked up.I'm depressed.I'm fucking anxious.You know what I mean?Like that is just not it's not working for me anymore.This is why things aren't getting done properly.You know what?I mean?Because I work on a song but somehow I'm still feeling all fucked up and not comfortable and content.I'm staying with anything.You know if I start riding is good, but if it's anything like pulling teeth, I can't just enjoy the process and I just I don't know.I don't know how to fix that anymore.I just don't know what to do.I can't stop trying to accomplish all these things.You know, I don't know how to just fucking relax, you know what I mean?Yeah, it's anxious and depressed.Yeah, yeah, that's what it is mostly.Yeah.Identifix sure of myself to send you this girl that the one who said she slept who said she slept with whatever and even that right it wasIt's a little thing but it's not little too big thing.One of the pictures.I took I hated the picture of myself so much for my ankle.I started like I started focusing on my nose skin.I was like, oh my God, my nose looks awful looks awful.What the fuc?How can I have a nose job?How can I have a nose job and it's it looks like I mean II like I literally wanted to like smash my face with a hammer.And so I was so, you know, even though at the same time I was likeWhat the fuck am I thinking like why you know what?I mean?Like, I mean, I was surprised at my own reaction, but I couldn't stop myself from having that reaction and that's tiring and depressing and frustrating.It gives you headaches, you know.Yeah, and I just I hated I just was like I felt so ugly and fucking disgusting.But meanwhile, I'm like I'm like in my mind like thinking of concrete all these girls.I've been dating and howand I was like, all right, even the one who told me not to drink it the I was like welllike she's told me I mean, I don't think that means some that means something was attractive.I mean she wasn't drunk at all.So I don't and so in other words, I was trying to get my selfie stupid very immature hats.Approved.Yeah.Right, right.but then again that's almost more depressing because then I was like because now I'm in a place where I'm like, yeah, but that that's howdepressing ass has that stuff doesn't matter and he's moments.I can go through all the list of all the beautiful women that have thought.I'm handsome or whatever the facts butYeah, and what's up?Yes, sorry.What do you do?Yeah.Yeah, it's great.I know know I know butI know I know.know that I get all that it's just like I said what unfortunately that could also make it more depressing because you're like wow, and I'm justLike I'm still working on this shit and it's you know.Like its just oh my God, you know what I'm saying?like I just feel likeThis is a just yeah, it just makes me feel like Yep.This this is it I could be working on this probably maybe for years and years.And in the meantime is opportunities to connect with a woman blah blah mean like that.It's likeI hope I'm trying to climb out ofshould I keep thinking I'm almost out of it, but I justYeah.Yeah, I know I get that.I mean that's what I'm saying.I recognize that that's why I feel more depressed and kind of fucked up is because I'm staying with these feelings like at home, you know.Yeah, I watch Netflix or whatever but I don't try to I don't try to put these things out of my mind anymore whatever and I see them for what they are.And I know that it's healthier and all that but it's like right now like, you know, I'm like totally, you know, like head achy all over here and like I'm not good over here.You know what I mean?Like, I'm getting that tighten saying you get with the Panic or anxiety where you almost feel like you're outside of yourself a little bit.It's like unnerving, you know.Yeah.You know what?I was thinking I had another idea for a book.And I wonder if this is the one that needs to be written in a way like all these things are leading to I was just thinking you know what maybe I need to write a really really like Stark naked honest brutal maglish memorize whatever of all my experiences with women, you know what I mean?And I was even thinking that way for about I immediately of course went to the publishing thing and I was like, you know Fifty Shades of Grey books that I can you know, I can maybe work some shit out, but also write something very entertaining.So well, yeah, but I wonder if you know what I mean, like, I wonder if I need to you know, I never write about this.The one thing I don't write about.like I write a written some love poem type, you know what I mean, butnever this kind of forget the love.Gracie side the nitty-gritty the kind of you know, the fucked-up emotional residue but it leaves aspect of choices that you make the regrets that you end up having.You know, whatever like there's a lot to write.I mean each girl could be a chapter and I have a very long book.I don't know like it suddenly hit me that maybe there's something that because you know.Yeah, yeah.Well, but even the music is romanticize kind of know what I mean.It's romanticized.because you knowYeah.You know, I have a list right?Like two years ago.I was like, you know what I need to write down every every name of every girl supplice.I think I told you this.No.Is I wanted to you know, yeah, it's not.I'm not like particularly proud of it.Wait, what did you say?I wanted to I was forgetting likeWhen I stop to think of all the girls I've slept with.I forget a lot of them and it seems weird to me.So when I wanted it just somehow remember is many as possible and it's a long list.There is something about having it like that.It just it help me.It's you know food for thought I would like I was like, that's too many and then I realize it's also like a secret.I can't even tell my guy friends like they be like, holy shit.Like I can't I mean we're talking like I mean a lot like usually over 80.I don't know if that's a lot, you know.So but I guess what I'm saying was maybe this is Ben.Percolating.Yeah, I mean the Samantha sessions.Yeah, I like this idea that maybe there's something I really need to work out though through writing writing or music about this.Right, right.And I thought you know, it's also it would be a perfect theme in the same of the fucked-up crazy adventure with all these women and also compasses everything or talked about even a dead stop even the sea the Assyrian.So in a way, it's like perfect.Okay.Thanks fire.Is that it for me?Thank you.See you soon.okay thanks this is $100so at least twohow's it goingso last week is weird last week is very weird I was sleeping the whole week I don't know what the fuck was going on but I was sleeping every day until like two one I don't know like I was exhausted it was really weirdI don't know and it happens to me sometime so it's hard not to get a little hypo now hypochondria chondriacI don't know if it's that I'm snoring at night and I'm not resting so like I'm not going into a deep sleep.I don't know what the fuck it is, but the weird thing last week.Was it was all week?I mean it was all fucking week when I left her on Monday.Usually I go to Starbucks or just kind ofor just try to get stuff done.I got all the way to Starbucks in or something in me.I could just feel like I was absolutely exhausted.I don't know but then.With all that shit with the fire department and the it was already an exhausting week.You know what I mean?Like it was a weird week.I was already feeling that way and then with all that shit, I don't know.But here's the weird thing Friday evening.I think or late afternoon and I saw this video this Army but who went from not being able to walk that well to like losing tons of weight.And I mean he was on disability.He was all messed up.So there's this amazing video of this guy who decided to learn yoga and you went to all these yoga teachers and told him and told them his story and they're like, it's really hard for you can barely walk.So it's going to be very difficult to do these poses one.Yoga teacher kind of took him in and look I lost a little weight and now he like runs.He's completely changed his life.Nothing is thing about it is I was sobbing I was like, maybe this is emotionalIs it somehow emotionally backed up all week?Cuz I was like sobbing and it's not it's very anyone that doesn't get emotional watching.This video is an idiot.But to like be sobbing like that.I don't know.I just need to have a really good cry and then suddenlyno, yeah.Yeah, I guess so.He seems like such a nice guy, you know, and I'm pretty skeptical skeptical.So it was also like the way the video was made with music at justis just made in a way that it touches all those buttons, but just the story itself the guy I mean, he was a fat he had to walk with those two things like crutches or whatever massive leg braces and stuff.He was in Iraq vet and they show him trying all the poses.He keeps following.I mean, it's just it doesn't get better than someone who seemed so sweet the so committed.You know what it is.You know what it is it like I can't explain part of it.well, I mean, it's just likecuz you to shame a little bit.I wasn't crying cuz of bad because but for someone to be able to overcome something like that and some one who seems soWho seems to deserve such a sweet person?It's just I don't know I was sobbing was really weird.Well, it's like I can't go to the gym for 15 minutes.See you in a little bit exercise.This poor guy is like seriously overweight disabled, you know, it gives you perspective.That's not why I was crying, but that's one of those things that took away which is which I think is what you should take away from it that the message of the video don't ever think you can't do something.I think that's what it was.The video was telling me something no one else had ever told me, you know,That you can do anything in the fact that someone believed in him, you know didn't give up on him.Then I was trying to remember the other times when I felt so exhausted is this what happens something makes me cry and suddenly, I feel better.I think it might be sometimes you know, yeah.I did I don't know anymore.Was Wednesday today?I was saying the weird shit my Mom said or something.Yeah, I often don't say that.I feel so tired because it happens kind of so often.But yeah, I probably should have mentioned it.Oh, no, no.No, I was really feeling really awful week really off.I mean, yeah that day.That's all I did.I came here and even that day I woke up right before I head come here and then back home.I got in bed and kind and just kind of took away like a long nap.Got up kind of ate something and got back into like I was justYeah, yeah, like it was to the point to where I didn't mention it to my mom.I was feeling like so what the fuck is going on here.I couldn't even hide it in the evenings.I was just like yeah, I was just like totally like remember I was saying I was kind of going down there and not being talkative.Just there must have been I don't know.Maybe that's just going to happen.Sometimes like doing this to my mind tends to have so many.I'm trying to do so many things maybe sometimes it's just exhausting.I don't know or it gets the point where it's like a bottleneck these things are kind of flowing, but then maybe there are times when it suddenly it just gets kind of plugged up.So until I have a really good cry or something kind of Judges me over the that I just like feel drained or something.Was it the weekend or something like last weekend?Because I told you either.Wednesday so yeah, it was sometimes it was sometimes between the weekend and Monday.Yeah, like I was handling it kind of but in a different way, I was kind of you know.Yeah, I know.Maybe that's what it is.Maybe like I just don't know what to do with that now and not going to run away from my hometown just cuz of you know what I mean.it's likehow how do people and I know I'm not the only one how do people handle these things when they'reStill kind of around their families in one way or the other.Yeah, I mean you got to do something, you know, and I'll also you know what it was in retrospect cuz the other thing I thought after I had that good cry I thought maybe like over the weekend at some point.I mean she show Celia to kind of love you never gave me like how weird is that?It's just unconditional shoes melt like I thought of that and then there was one point where my uncle was over right around the fire department.I got upstairs to fix the garbage.I got a lot of shit done a lot of logistical fix some stuff around the house the garbage disposal just that day before replace some of the fire some of the fire alarms smoke detectors and I did my uncle was there he didn't do anything but he just because he was there at kind of help me to get some I was like, oh uncle.Can you I'm trying to fix the store that he looked at me.He didn't really do anything.But just another prayer eyes help me to be a little more motivated, you know what helps?It's not like my mom wasn't grateful to me, but I felt like she was more grateful to she made it sound like he did something.She was just a jerk about it.She doesn't get it, you know.What's that?Yes, stuff like that or even or like even yesterday try calling.Calling her all day.Cuz if I don't hear from her for long stretches, I get a little worried like my grandmother or her in the snow or whatever her cell phone won't Buzz or she doesn't hear it.Whatever.It's like I don't answer my phone after a couple time.She is kind of aggravated.I don't say anything.I've generally concerned.I'm not annoyed.I don't give a shit if you're not answering.I just want to make sure everything's okay.It's just I don't know she just a difficult person.nauseousa lot there is to it.Like I said, it's not just with her kind of with the whole family.I just shown I'm just finding things more in a weird way more exhausting when they actually happen when things happen.They really annoy me and maybe cuz nowI just know.What's what and I know there's not really.Much just say I mean it will be ridiculous to have some kind of blowout.So it's almost like this crazy like this very deflating kind of feeling I guess.I mean, I don't think there's much more that I could do.I don't you know, I mean, even if I go down there are you generally generally don't speak don't spend that much time at the most maybe an hour.I'll just dessert for like maybe an hour but rarely is usually just a few minutes.I don't know what elseYou know, I don't think it would even really that different if I live across town.You know what I mean?You're in the same your here.Your memories are here my and I don't want to run away.I don't put myself in this Tino.I'm kind of looking for my future now but my house and I don't want to give someone else a grand or two grand whatever it is for some shity apartment when I have a home that I'm comfortable and so it's a balancing active.I love it here.I don't want to live in another town.I loved it.SoI mean, I think that's I think it is what it is in some ways.That's you know, maybe that's one of the reasons why I've been feeling better.I have a much more like I'm just taking care of myself, you know, they're not going to change their not.It is what it is.So I have to try to you know.feelings about whatI just feel like hurting angry, you know.I mean, you know.Like the thing is when I think about it, it's again the problem with all this shit is old feelings because that day when I first at the end of the day, it seemed like she was thanking him more but you could argue it's because he was leaving in a way.She's also smart lady.She wants to let a brother know she's giving him a little extra.To let him feel like she really cares.But he comes around and it's kind of she's kind of a sending him a signal.Do you know what I mean?But earlier when I first got home she hugged me All My Sons hear he's doing so much today and a steering in a Syrian.She said very nice things she gave me a hug.So it's one of those things where if I had to I had made a stink about it.I was just felt stupid right after I I had another blowout I would have felt like oh that wasSo when I sell in the moment had nothing to really to really do with that moment.It's just years and years and years of just feeling like she doesn't appreciate or she it all goes back to it doesn't feel unconditional doesn't feel you know, she's a sickle kind of person who sometimes it's very polite and kind of oddly when she is she's usually not like it's this weird.It'sbury my grandfather.Yeah, but I guess when I say the past but I mean is that if everything else has been difficult your mom or your dad says something wacky to present you deal with it differently.It'd be much more than a little glitch like mon mom.There'd be more of a lightness about it.That's what I mean.I think I mean everybody I mean maybe not everybody is but from what I've seen around me, I feel like a lot of parents say some odd things that they maybe we don't intend to stay.But that can be kind of purple and frustrating.Whatever, but when it's coming after years of all this shit.I mean, it's pretty it is pretty rare.She doesn't really say that stuff.I don't know.I'm not trying to defend her it's shity.What no.No it it took shity.There's no way around it.It's awful.I don't even know what to say about it.I guess I'm so focused on the Absurd of the other day and you do that helps me.What?Yeah, yeah.No, yeah, I don't think I'm focused on.I mean, I think I tell myself that.could try to feel a little better butOh, yeah.I've always been like that, right?I don't really cry and her that much, you know, it's just very private I guess.What's that?Why I'm not against it it just I mean I asked I have but it has to feel has to come at house to can't force yourself.What's that?Oh, well, maybe yeah.Right, right.Maybe that's what I need to try.I mean what I like about the way I'm handling.All this stuff is I think there's a lot to be said we're having a kind of like is what it is attitude and not in a bad way, butIn a I don't know.I think it's feels kind of help me to be like, you know, what sometimes this is going to happen.Sometimes I'm going to feel whatever and sell last week or whatever.You know what?She's old and she's not going to be around forever.That doesn't excuse.Shepherd that helps me to just I don't know like in tandem with this because it is so like vulnerable and 3 days a week.It's awesome.I look forward to it.But I think the balance of this is it feels kind of good to be tough in a way like without ignoring how she is or whatever but just be like, you know what?That way, you know how to handle it.You handle it by giving a talk at the Assyrian Library.You handle it by doing your work?I already got the job.But you know what?I mean.I got invited to do a poetry reading whatever the biggest kind of creativity riding Association.Is having their conference year.No, it's National saying it's like the MLA my friend who runs this Workshop.Whatever the fucking thing they're doing a reading and she's like you want to be the featured reader.I haven't said yes, but I'm going to you know, it's really not a big deal, butthese are the ways.Yeah, I kind of I kind of don't care but I'm going to say yes.I think these are the ways there's no other way.My mom's not going to stop saying those are shifters.Got2b a day.todayyou know, I think and I thinkthat's the waythat was the thing about the video and I think also part of the crying was again.It's that morning and then part of the crying was I'm finally kind of getting this now what I got level instead of up here and I'm like no I want to finish my novel and I want to do this reading I wantTo have a talk at the Museum in finish my record.That's the only way.Yeah.Right, right.Yeah, I was thinking about it other than feeling shity about missing our appointments once in awhile, like things are City.Do you know what I mean?I'm not some programmed.I'm not doing my homework.I am living my life and I don't feel so guilty about the PHD or whatever.I think it's going to get it done one way or the other at some point, but I'm not sweating it but it's not my I'm not a fucking scholar.I don't give a shit about it.I want to finish it for me.So like I think that's the kind of stuff that does make me feel a lot better.I pulled up my manuscript for the new book and I was like shit man.Some of these poems are really fucking good.I had looked at them in months.There's really no other way.There's no other way.Also with Kelly but by not letting any of that affect we had a fucking amazing weekend.We had a such like she's awesome.I was going to tell you this if this is the first relationship I've had where the sex has gotten better with the more open.We've beeneven the littlest thingthis past weekend was the first time I really felt like we were really making out is that weird like really making out in the stacks?I don't know if she's amazing.So that feels good.Like I'm not bringing any of that shit.Oh, she's a little overweight.She's I don't give a fuck.She's freaking beautiful and awesome.That was something that was awesome that it wasn't even a fight.You know what, I mean miscommunication.That's amazing.We didn't even have any words.Yeah, she's like hey, we haven't talked in a couple of days.She came over and was like and that was it.I already see you like Friday.Thought we were just going.To get together Saturday.She's like do you want to get together Friday toI Can Tell She's after that.But all whatever is that was we both talked.We were both scared.She's very it's different.It's different.I mean the whole week was too much but maybeMaybe the whole week felt like that.That makes sense.Oh, yeah.Of course.Right, of course because some days that perspective work some days.It doesn't.Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree.Well, I just think what happens is like part of that side of me.That just says well, I mean there's kind ofNo time limit on morning, so it's just that.That makes me scared.But it just makes me feel like the acknowledging part is definitely covered that you know, I feel like the bearing is like that's kind of what I've been doing away.I know what you're saying, but I kind of feel likeI mean maybe the way I feel about it is like this is really helpful because when I'm alone I can stop and not the minute, you know what I mean?To me.That's what works.It's a very private thing to me.I don't know.But when it happens now, I don't feel weird.I don't feel bad.It's my kind of welcome mat, you know.It always does.No, it always does it always does.The last time I felt very disturbing was the time I told you when I first got to London.That felt really unsettling and I was only because I just felt really alone.I felt likethere wasn't anybody I could call or hang out with I just felt really weird and alone and just unsettled ever since then every time I had a job like that.I always understood the clear reason more or less and I've always felt better.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, I feel like the stuff at home was almost like the homework like that's the stuff you got to you know, and I do wish it would happen in here more.I mean, it makes me a little uncomfortable, but I've been doing this long enough.I'm fine with it.That's just not it's got to just happen.Naturally you canYeah, maybe.I mean I had the feeling that actual crying thing is hard for me to do not her is justit just doesn't happen in front of people that I just and I'm fine with that.I'm not trying to hold anything back some people but I do know what you're saying for getting the crying thing.But I mean it's hard to you know, because ITyler'sdon't know what to say about it.I feel I feel it.I don't know.What's shit.It makes me feel like shit.I just don't do you know what I mean?Like literally I don't know what the other will eyes say it say that it makes me feel shity or something.Maybe you're right.Maybe that's a way to not sit with it or whatever.Remember when I told you that last week, I've lined up some dates on.Okay stupid.Well, I didn't go on any of them.There's this one girl, who when we started talking and we we we realize that we were already Facebook friends.So it is I feel guilty now, but I'm going to tell her and send her an email like look full disclosure added situation.That was a little complicated.It's no longer.It's kind of gone to the next level.Is it bad enough?Like she's like a musician.We have kind of the same Circle.She's a musician and studies like trauma in therapy.So it is there is no reason to feel guilty right if I just hang out to make a friend have coffee with her or something.Oh, yeah, because I feel like I'm being a little overly sensitive, but I have no intention of anything.Well, I'm going to we had made plans, but I'm going to send her an email me like full disclosure.This is what's going on.You seem cool.We have a lot in common and we know all the same people.Could we just grab a coffee?I think it's because I care so much I justYou know how I get things are going so well with Kelly.I feel like I just want things to keep going.Well, I don't want any weirdness which is why that's why I'm saying I feel like I'm overthinking and being really, you know,of course, that's a gray area.But my feelings is obviously the part that part doesn't need to come up.She's somebody she's someone that I'm Facebook friends with only she's a musician have a feeling that some point are circles will overlap anyway, and you know how I am and I'm kind of good at networking and I just feel like you never know.It's good toNetworking and it's also nice to I don't know a lot of people that are so interested in like trauma and who are musicians just to remember what I was saying about my friendships and like I think I at this point they're like, Donnie Mike Matthew three or three or four people at this point who are regularly.I don't know.I just think it's important to start branching out.You know what it is you down of matter what I'm still not quite over the feeling of being totally alone.You know, I think that's in terms of like really feeling that's the feeling.I'm just I'm still not quite its way way better when I'mvoice like Donnie like I don't feel alone.I feel very connected.But because all of this all ofthat is all is relatively new.It feels like it could just go away or whatever.So I realized how deep I feeling is you know that I just feel kind ofYeah.Yeah.Brightwell Cecilia's hereIt really is I think.I'll take it.I'll take it.Perfect.Skipso next week is when I'm going out of town with Kelly.So I won't be here Monday.So and I think I won't be back in time Wednesday.So maybe next week we can so I'll miss Monday, but we can keep Thursday Friday.And then the week after yeah, totally.Yeah do Wednesday Thursday Friday?That's awesome.So it'll be one 12:50 and 11.11:30no, no.No, it's awesome.That's awesome.Cool.Thanks for sure.Have a good rest of the day.See you.So I don't know what's going on this week thing that I've been really noticing and something I've had all along that I think we haven't really dressed in here.I think is important because it really bothers me but I feel super it hasn't been non-stop all week.But I've been feeling like super aggravated Melancholy sarjak.That's not a good combination.I don't know like today.I'm super fucking annoyed every little thing.I just don't I don't know.I just don't like that.That's the kind of thing that my friend Dave does who I think of like will joke once in a while.I'm out like that to like it just really bothers me.That I get like that.Today was the first thing was I go out out there trash garbage was yesterday or this morning?andit's like I just get annoyed.Downtown has these new craftsman things, which is great, but I went out there one of my and one of the neighbors Ben's it somehow gone on our side and I don't know why it just took me off.I annoy the fucking shit out of me.Are you sure we're in the garbage guys know they're doing all this shit.They just kind of dumped a little a little more on our side.You know, it's just annoyed me like all these fucking garbage cans in front of our house.So I was moving it and then my mom showed up with her with my grandmother and adenoids me.Like of course, I can't just be in peace like this fucking moment.You have to show up.I don't I don't know that just annoyed me.I don't know.I just felt really annoyed really annoyed then to just get a cup of coffee.It sounds likeAn old man, but it has gotten so fucking crowded.It's like that.It's like it has become this major thoroughfare.It's like no parking people are double-parked people are honking and of course everyone to ass also.Assholes they know how to park.They don't know how to use their signals, you know.I was like what theso that just annoyed me.I don't know just everything.I don't know.I just feel aggravated.It's bothering me.Yeah, I know.That's what I was thinking of like and must be some you know, it's again, it's that feeling that somehow people are doing something on purpose to me.You know what I mean somehow.I don't but it's not the case, but I don't know when I was little I used to have a bad temper.I think I've said that so I'm sure it's somehow connected.I used to have just like Dido from being the way I normally am like, I'm very patient and then you do not want to be around me ifNo.If I you know washed it and then end like it even happened here.I was like what the fuck somebody at 12:50.What the fuck?It's 12:53.What the fuck?Why are you are getting soyou know I getthese little thingsit's really it's like my friend Dave were very it's like personal.it's as if he's totallyit says if it's totally personal and it's like I don't like that feeling, you know.That's like and then I don't like the flipside which is that I've been feeling just really lethargic like kind of melancholy or something like that.I'm just kind of sluggish and tired and just blah.I don't know.What's what that's all about.Like I'm seeing Kelly tomorrow.I should be really excited.You know, I'm sure I will be when I see her but almost feeling worried like I haveLike I feel like I'm kind of out of it at or tired.I feel a little bit like what ifLike I don't know if it's all these negatives it's weird.I'm like, oh what if I don't know what if I don't perform.Well, sexually or what if I snore when were were asleep.Like weird little you know what?I mean?Like, I don't know man.It's really weird.But I just figured because I don't know.ifWe've ever talked about that in here on my way here.I was like, you know why I just don't get it.It's not obviously it's part of me.It'snot really me.You know what?I mean?I don't know.I don't like getting so worked up about these things.No, that's the thing.I think that's what I decided today, but isn't a small thing just like I don't think it because of what I thought I thought my friend day.I was like when he gets like this, I don't think it's a small thing.Right.I always think man this poor guy.Like there's something deep in him that you know, well, it's the same thing.It's like everyone has that gets aggravated a little here and there butthese moments of just intense like I'm giving myself a headache.It's like my head hurts.It's like there's no reason for that is a nice day out.I'm here.Like what's the problem, you know?you mean personally, howI think it's like I don't know.It's like I think it's like part of it.It's like what the fuc doesn't Trisha know what time it is or something or getting annoyed at whoever the person your Patron is that their Ramblin there somehow encroaching on your time, like maybe it's time to go and they're still so I don't know.I don't really know what it is.It's just yeah, it's just kind of like it's too close for comfort.I feel like you know or then I'llfeelLike how the fuck should I be ready to talk to me or anybody when she just talk to this person?You know, I don't know.It's just like a combination of all these but yeah them all.the bottom of the line if feels too close for comfort somehow if you like things areThere isn't like breathing a buffer a room.Again, I think it's just the idea.Is there when he immediately someone else kind of encroaching, you know what I mean?I think that's what it is.I don't care that there are people.At Dunkin Donuts, it's just when it's so fucking it's almost claustrophobic the double parking lot parking properly.Then you walk in there and there's a fucking half-ass line and just like, I don't know there's something about it.I don't care if there's people if there's some people there but then there's some order, you know, my guess I'll be around and you know, I think that's what it is part of what it is.I mean, for example, I never go to Star Market or CVS or the mall or Target.I never ever go to those places during any time when I think there's a lot of people I just don't like I'd rather go there 10 at night and just feel calm and there's plenty room and you know.Now some of that I think a lot of people do that.Me and I are friends who are like that too.They don't want to go to Target when a sealant when they're Sicilian people, but I think that there's definitely more you know.Well, but it is so it's claustrophobic in terms of like this fantasy that somehow their encroaching on MySpace.That's like what?Exactly.Like you have all this room.Why is your shit here?I don't get that, you know until I actually I do get it in a way because it's like probably there were 20 cars.They're parked their fucking garbage guys came.They took the cans.That's where they saw there were some there was some space to leave that and they fucking left.I mean, they're not, you know, I know that no one is doing anything on purpose, but it's more how I'm reacting to it.No, no, it's more just again, it's this feeling that of that somehow people are disrespectful or impolite and yeah, there's something overwhelming and cautious throwback about it.I don't know how I how I can explain it.It's kind of like when I'm walking into center of the square, you know, that there's this all these fucking freaks and people yelling at each other and drug addicts and Weirdos like that.I hate it or something.I can't stand about that.You know, I'm not alone.I know it's not send anything.I know I have a couple of friends who cannot stand walking around Central walking around in Central Square.But again, it's a combination of it would be one thing if that kind of stuff just bothered me, but this feeling is getting out of getting so aggravated is just what I don't like.In the weird thing was I woke up and I got a lot done like it has some errands I know.I'm took, you know, like I've been kind of on top of things, you know, so I don't even know why I like.Yeah, yeah, it's funny.I was thinking about that too on my way here.I was like a wonder if it's just the way IThat I feel like all of downtown is I mean, this is where I'm from.So maybe that's the thing.I like well I do love it here, but I also want to be left alone, you know, so I wonder if you know what I mean.Like it's like I've always known that I mean in a unique situation.I know a lot of people leave their hometowns and they moved butWhen you like where you're from?What am I supposed to do?You know what?I mean?Like I guess if I was like really uncomfortable and well-off I would just live somewhere else in this area and you know what I mean, butyou know, so I don't know.I wonder ifIf that's what it is, I feel like I don't know.I don't know if that's totally true.I have a feeling that.It's a lot of the other stuff that's been going on, which is that a lot of this bag revation or whatever.It's not in the present.You know what I mean?It's like some old thing is coming up in situations slitter.Not really that aggravating.I don't know.I mean, I'm just saying that I think it's probably old.I don't know justI think I'm just thinking about being a kid in like when I lose my temper my temper, obviously there was something going on.Obviously my family annoyed or whatever the fuck I don't know butI mean, I don't know I guess just likeI don't know not getting along with my mom or feeling alone or bored.Yeah angry annoyed.Now when I was a kid, I don't think I felt claustrophobia.I know it's I know that I feelSo even that noise annoys a chamois.I hate that.I hate that I'm like that.That's awful.That's so awful.Yeah, because it's mean it's I mean, it's a little too much like every little thing sets me off likeit really makes me super angry andThat's like what they're just looking just someone sitting here.They're not it's just you know, you know what it what it is.It's just feel so childish like it's so fucking amateur.No, no.No, they do matter and just saying.Well, what sort is happens on days like this?I feel like I was going to be one of those days where I'm it's almost like I'm asking for it in other words.Because I feel this way that shit's going to happen all day.There's going to be some little tick.It's like I'm being poked and prodded like I was at bothering you today people driving shity and too many people will hate so all day.There's going to be shit is going to be weird noises of people like in your space.They're going to be you know,yeah, right exactly.Yeah.Yeah, we're like in the past like I'm very sensitive to noise.It does bother me, but I've got really good at just being like okay, we all make a little we all live in a society.So no one is doing it on purpose like I've gotten better way better at that.But yeah.But then when it's days like this.like every little thing becomesjust what I was saying like it becomes my state for the day.That is not going to be a peaceful day.Like I can't just have a mellow peaceful.Yeah, I don't know.I don't know what it is.For example out.I'm going to go to Starbucks and this is going to be the one day where it's like a madhouse.I can't get a place to stay and I gotta gotta leave.I can't I'm just or I'm just going to stand here for a while waiting for some douchebag to leave in like it's going to be an easy day.It's not going to be an I don't know.Then I think what happens is.is that when trickles or turns into self-defeating thoughts, you know what I mean, like wellI'm not going to fucking go to the gym.I'm not like, you know, it just becomes veryself because what happens on days like this when it's this bad cuz I'm paralyzed for the day.Like I just want to get through the day.I can't do anything.I can't think straight.Can't really enjoy anything.It's very difficult.Yeah, I don't know like what bothers me ultimately 2 about.That is like I end up feeling like this total utility.Like I just like, you know, it's tied into that whole self-defeating.As a baby though.I mean why I can't even understand that because I mean the weird thing is that I think it is a baby.That's when I was most loved I was there was no other baby in the family.I was the first one and I've seen the all the pictures photos and stuff like that, you know and the center of attention so I can't see howThat would be the case when I got a little bit older.Or maybe maybe there's something I'm not I'm not aware of.That's interesting.Yeah, that's a good point.People can't just suddenly change when you're four or five.that's a good point especially with their miscarriage and everything maybe she projected her anger on me or weird feelings or whateveryeah that's opposite but everything is invested in this one kid actually looks more like what it isafter meNo, I think I was in North Carolina.I mean it's definitely before I have a memory.I have no memory at all of her being pregnant or anything like that anyso I'm assuming it was before I was five like 4, maybe it was here that I don't know.I think so.I mean knowing them and knowing that generation very few people were like, let's stop at 1, you know, especially someone like her who isn't who's not competing so much but you definitely cares about what otherWhat others are doing and I don't know any of her friends.I think maybe one two families.Maybe that have one kid, but they all have at least two or three.Her sisters have to her brother has to you know, and also I'm sure my dad had five siblings.I'm sure he wanted one more.Recently, yeah.Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure it's funny.I was just thinking I didn't make the connection but yesterday was almost a really annoyed.We've been having trouble getting a show locally like yesterday.It really fucking annoyed me like, you know what I forgot.What a fucking clicky, you know.High School Lee fucking saying this town is with indie-rock.It's like everybody and their friends just getting each other shows.It's all it is same couple of bands.Just rotating.I wonder if it's somehow connected if it's connected somehow, that's really been on my mind.That's like what the fuc or even New York Lakeside only I'm not hearing any news from any venues.I don't know.It's been kind of annoying.No, well, I've been pushing to get a show that hasn't and that hasn't happened.I've been pushing to get the CD release party together and that's like not happening.It's just like, you know, it's remind me of how you used to feel with my first.I've always had the slightly antagonistic which works for me and I think that's good.I don't want to be so in the scene or whatever, but now it's getting a little bit annoying like I mean, we got to play shows.I mean it doesn't make sense to you or it doesn't make sense for it to be this difficult.It's about really annoyed me yesterday.I was like, fuck me and fuck these people.Because it really is.like it's just a click and I've been out of the scene for a long time and evenBack, then I wasn't really I was but I wasn't you know what I mean?I wasn't really so but like I said, I kind of like it like that to thrive a little bit on being that because I know how good music is so I know it will feel better to make them come around instead of I'm not going toKowtow to any to anybody.It's just fucking annoying.But even that's weird like I went to Guitar Center yesterday.I got like I'm setting myself up at home to be able to do better record.So that's the weird thing like I do, you know what I mean?That's kind of where I don't get this week like things are good.You know what?I mean?Where isI feel like in the past all this annoying when I feel annoyed.Generally I point at things and say well this isn't going well.This isn't going well.I don't have a girlfriend.I know I know, you know, I know.I you know what?I mean.I don't have that now.I don't know this morning.I woke up.I wrote a bunch of bills.I you know, I don't know.I had a breakfast, you know what I mean?Like, I don't know.I don't.No, I'm saying I don't get this week in particular why it's been so.Yeah, I kind of sad and mostly aggravated.Yeah.Maybe yeah, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised they say isn't anger just like sadness or something.Yeah, I think that's true.Yeah, I guess that's true.Is it bad or like my band can't go on tour without me or like all these things?I like either have to end up.Doing a loner.Yeah.And maybe that's why I'm seeing you tomorrow and maybe that's what's happening.It's like when I feel this whatever aggravated and angry or sad or whatever.Is that feeling like?Yeah, put, you know brace yourself because I'm sure something will go wrong.It won't work out or like this is gender something.I don't know what the feeling is, butNoah started Tuesday.I saw a really crazy dream Monday night and Tuesday.I literally woke up in this in this never happened.I woke up feeling kind of just Melancholy and fly just wasn't feeling it.Tuesday was a weird day.The dream was I was in a bar and made friends with an NBA player whose in aIn a bar who's also in movies.Man, I think he's a white guy.I'm not sure but super nice.Like we can't we can't really type friends or something really nice person.And then from there I somehow got two checks in each check was for 99 Grand.Then I remember I was like, so it was not a bad dream.I was happy that I had this friend.I was pretty happy.I got two checks for 99 Grand whatever been a sort of change then I'm driving and I don't know where I was.I don't know.It seems like the South but I didn't know the highway or whatever and I was just driving in there.Is either a laptop or TV in the car with Netflix on order movies?It was just one recurring thing.I having dreams which is that I am either running or driving and I'm fucking sleepy.So I'm driving and I'm almost are Jake and feeling weird.Whatever.I'm also trying to watch blippi on the TV, I think but the thing about it was it was beautiful like it was this very easy autumn.So the trees are still very Lush but they're changing colors and I think the sunlight with you.It was beautiful.It was really really awesome.So then I turned off the road.And it was like a college of some kind of college and there weren't a lot of people there there were hardly any people there and then I ran into my friend and told me that she wanted to become a doctor.She said you want to go to medical school and I was like great.I think I gave her some tips on grad school or something and that was it.Oh then after I was talking to her I saw two women who were from a Siri or something.So I kind of chatted with them in a Syrian but again, it wasn'tNone of it was nightmarish are stressful.Only Parts.I didn't like were because of this point of my dream.I hear recognize.Here we go.Again.I'm trying to drive.I can't keep my eyes open and I'm exhausted.But other than that, it was like really beautiful.I don't know but I woke up when I was like, I was just super I just woke up down.When I woke up.Yeah, definitely felt a little bit discombobulated a little bit.That's why I immediately wrote it down.And I was like what the fuck was that all about?I guess huh?Yeah.Yeah, that was part of the dream.I don't understand.I don't know what that was all about.It was so beautiful and peaceful.I guess yeah.Yeah.Yeah, and I don't know why I'm always I can't drive without feeling awful.No.No, I mean that you know, like someone some people have recurring dreams.I don't have any any of that.The only recurring thing I have my dreams.The only thing I can.Never ever be in a car driving and not feeling like shit.I always feel like shit.Like I literally will be swerving like you can't keep my eyes open.It's a really awful feeling.Now, I don't know if this started after DUI thing, you know, maybe.No, okay.Okay.Yeah, I guess well just because I don't remember having this recurring dream for years and years and years.It feels relatively just in thein the last few years then again, I never used to remember my dreams.So who the hell knows but yeah, that's the thing not so much even running really it really is driving.Throw your water driving and awful driving or else I feel like shit in the past would rationalize.like well, maybe it's because I'm snoring so I'm actually not sleeping well andYeah, I think it's I'm trying to get somewhere, but I don't feel completely.It's as if the car is driving me.I don't know what road I'm on.I can't usually right.I usually I can usually not recognize anything.Yeah, it's because yeah, it's not like okay.I'm going to get in the car and go see Dave or I'm going to get in the car and drive to the coast.or I'm suddenly in the forest and whereit's beautiful, you know.310Thanks, Tricia Sia.So, I don't know if I mentioned that my type of medication is changing.Yeah, which is not really.Oh, I think I met with her like the day after we last met a day or two.I'm switching off Lexapro and onto Celexa or Celebrex whichever one is actually in a depressant.Yeah, she said it was kind of like unfortunately.She's like soYou're going to feel like crap for a while and I was like, oh, well, then awesomely right on schedule.I started feeling like crap the 23rd 24th.Yeah.She had actually predicted that one of the worst day is probably going to be around the 27th, and it was horrible.Yeah Ikea today with my parents and my mom and offered to drive me home, but we had a little miscommunication.There was some miscommunication about me staying 3 days longer and when I realized that I was like I almost we were out at my parents house.And this all came and I'm like, I don't know if I can move her go to dinner or do anything.So I was just like, oh my God, I can't do three more days.Actually it would have been for more days at that point.Amazingly my parents.My mom did not freak out about me staying about me saying, so I'm leaving tomorrow with surprise me a lot, but she didn'tThursday so what Christmas is Wednesday, so yeah the 26th.It was likeyeah, I think my mom knows I wasn't feeling great.Because she was also being really anxious and one of the ways she likes to express this is just to stare at me a lot with a concerned face or speak really loudly and try to drive me into conversation, which doesn't work very well.Add appointment brother is sort of a talk to Mom.I can't do it.Yeah, I mean the trip was it was okay for the first few days or so.I was like, oh, okay Christmas to you happened Christmas happened, butThat was okay, but I felt like I don't know the bed.She had me sleeping is extrude excruciating Lee and comfortable and my brother's wife gets really cold is Italy so that he doesn't like seven day and I will end it like 66 or 67.So I'm always hot and sweaty and I end up having to buy myself to shirt so I can wear something always so frustrating because there's no one no one of my house like my brother his wife my parents the largest shirt.In the house would probably be a smaller or medium so I couldn't borrow anything which always makes me feel awkward this year.My brother's like know.I have a loose shirt and I'm like, no that won't say I'm having that argument is just having the argument is just frustrating.I'm like look at the two of us I wouldn't fit and yeah, I'm still feeling I still feel like garbage.I just don't feel good, which is really frustrating.I told actually I was like, I'm really sorry.I doing this medication switch.Sorry and one day I think I think was this weekend.I was cooking something and Ashley was like, do you need any help and I was like no.No, I'm good.I was Keen to cook and then I suddenly wasn't feeling was feeling super resentful and angry at her for not helping to cook even though I hadn't asked her.In fact, in fact, I said know which made me feel so crazy because I'm just like I didn't even you know, I was both upset like I was still really upset about it, but also thinking you shouldn't be because you didn't ask what level also that was upsetting.Yeah, when we were talking doctor koth at one point was asking was I was worried that I might need to take some FMLA days off.I was feeling completely extra not great.Which I don't know why last week didn't happen.I was sick on Thursday Friday.I had it I had a snow day.So I feel like I've only been working for 2 days, so I don't know.We're supposed to have met on Wednesday, but he is but she's sick.So now she's saying probably a month at least.Actually wanted to switch off the Wellbutrin.Which we talked which we were talking about.But I have been.Having the sudden moments of feeling.Really intensely weepy and I don't know if they were increased but they weren't going away.So that concerned her I don't know.My response was like oh whatever.I'll tough it out.I can tough it out for a while, which is usually my response.I do agree not being super not I too agree.Not being randomly weepy would be good.If you know I could do my homework and work it would be nice.So I was talking to my mom about Wellbutrin how Wellbutrin makes me really sweaty and well and my my brother was like, oh, yeah that can happen to my mom's response was why doesn't your psychiatrist give you another drug?That's perfectly as good.That doesn't cause you to sweat.Thanks Mom.It was that easy mom.It was just so crazy like oh God.It'sIt was mostly funny.But I'm also like giving my mom's obsession with her how her children should be medicated.I would think that she would know more about how that might work just as well as had met major medication problems increasingly.She does not.Receive them as bad medication interactions.He took lithium and it didn't work for him.So and so my mom my mom's theory is that my brother insisted on taking Lithium because Dad took it andBut he was insisting on taking it.Even though someone maybe her said that he shouldn't.My mom is I think they gave him was the end because he's bipolar and that's what everyone does but my mom kind of really blames my brother for it's very strange.I don'tI've been asking her less about it about her thoughts and feelings about my brother because he's super frustrating.I also have this I don't know what conversation with my dad that stuck with me, which was I was talking to Will.I think I was talking to Ashby.My brother's wife asked me about my frustrations at work and I felt so frustrated with chat in like not being able to get him to give me work.Even when I asked directly and she was like, why don't you ask and likewise asking but you won't give it to me and then the conversation start of stops, which I understand.They don't have an answer in my dad was in the room and he was and I was just like while you're probably not paying attention, but what do you think and he said you want me to actually answer so his response was interesting first.He mentioned that I had expressed frustrations with managers many times before which is true.He feels that I do not communicate well enough.He thinks the problem is a communication problem along with a diplomacy issue, which I really disagree.I don't think it's so I asked him to explain because I was like, I don't know.I don't think I think I know how to communicate.It's true that I can't that I can't get pissy about diplomacy, but I'm perfectly capable of doing I just don't always want toYeah, so first he gave me his advice which was which is to out to do Stout cat out last people which is awful.But then his other thingI guess it's called the Ben Franklin effect or the Ben Franklin method, which is Ben Franklin Ben Franklin.There was someone I guess stud at one point and Congress in Congress.You didn't get along with him Ben Franklin hated this guy because he was a jerk and so Franklin decided the way to win him over was asked a jerk for a book that Franklin really wanted to read sauce to borrow the book return the book with a note.This was such a great book.Thank you so much for doing me a favor at the favor of letting this book.It was awesome blah blah blah and then after that he want over the person.And I told him I know where this is going, but my dad the sort of idea that my dad was going with which is that if there's someone you have a conflict.But you have conflict.That you're sort of thinking about your conflict with.What you want to do is put them in a position where you think you kind of manifest some doing something a nice for you and then you compliment them.That was so great.But you were nice to me or thank you so much for your notes early on whatever and though.and through this people like being commented complemented people like something useful soYes and Wild.While it's like a totally interesting idea.I feel like I still don't.Feel the root of the problem is communication or my lack.Or my lack my inability to communicate which I did.I told my dad.Mike fundamentally, I can't communicate communicate around there's no way for me to communicate around bertos racism or sexism.They can't hear me in that I just so I just stopped there's nothing really to do.You didn't respond to that but we did talk a little bit about I don't know if the where is diplomacy or other things, but my dad's worked or since 1980 you worked for for like 20 years.He wasn't Academia briefly before that as a professor.Yes, and he left Academia because he disliked politics or dad.We've already talked about how we both hate the same kind of politics and doing this you would think that I would hate that.Like I don't think my dad gets the extent to which there is really no pressure for someone.His if you're not a great manager, but you're not horrible.There's no pressure to make you leave.No, one says sales are down in the music library Department.There's nothing there's no one soand there is no.So if you're if you are moderately competent enough to show it to meetings.You are just going to get this into this position and then youBe there until you retire.I'm speaking broadly, but that's what happens.That's why people like University jobs.Retirement she's working within a 4-year product environment.Where people was where someone was really confident you'd be like me hear Department efficiency, whatever whatever whatever and that just doesn't exist.I guess I felt my dad was sort of operating under the idea that this was a if the workplace is in an Ascend isn't an essentially not a guilt not a guilt but like you're not the Invisible Hand while you knock the economy, I think at his head there some kind of invisible hand of Merit.And he also I don't think really believe in what I said I've asked for work and I don't get it.He's like, well, obviously the way you've been asking for work isn't working.So you should ask another way.There's only did number of ways to do it.Yeah, I can rephrase I can try.I can you know.Whatever I've done but in the end there's a the communication problem is my fault in the end and beavers only so many ways you can ask someone for work.There are very few.I understand is completely irrational and crazy and doesn't make any sense that this would be happening butand yeah, it's likewhen I talk about it people everyone's like come on.What would he say?Why would he say that there's always work for you to do and then not give you and I'm like, well, I don't know.That's a good question that I can't answer.I got very caught on.Why don't you just do something better?Yeah, yeah.I just did that.One thing that was funny is that I was talking to my dad more generally and he was like, well people probably know that you don't like your manager like well sort of I try not to express that generally people often say it to me.Oh, you must love having chat is your manager Pearl is your building head or whatever and I'm like, nope.I usually just don't answer.But if someone presses then I'll answer.My dad was like really they don't know how you feel.Okay fine, which is true.Like I'm sure than our department all staff meetings I haveKind of given up on pretending that I'm not frustrated.But all our staff meetings are actually not that many people and I don't know I guess I hope that I don't actually want to broadcast my fridge and content across the entire library.That would be bad and I'm special and also just not good.I think my dad is right that yes, certainly.Some people have noticed probably managers notice and I'm not thrilled.I mean you'd have to but the not entirely helpful response in my head is like wellI try really hard to be different product.But at this point buck.Which is I sometimes think.But like if I'm capable of being diplomatic and like sucking it up or whatever and if something is critical.Better someone's Behavior shoves me over the edge and part of me is like, well you deserve it because she is Christ.The level it would have to be to try and go get to that level to have to get to me.Like vocally.I work tell someone off is pretty insane, but that's a totally fine rationalization for me, but it doesn'tCarl and cheddar so in positions of power and black, you knowYeah.Sort of I have it's like he doesn't want to do an advice unless really expensive explicitly asked like really explicitly so I've asked him about dealing with racism at work and his response was by leaving them out and to try harder and that kind of thing.I was not surprised but he saidI left them out.I mean kind of what I have set him up said him not exactly.I don't know I kind of said I'm up.I also kind of want them to feel like that really sucks or offer some educated perspective.I mean, I think in the end he I think he really believes that if I had us chat in the right way that he would have been like, oh, here's whatever I talk to him about it and told him Berry is trusted details.Yeah hisYeah, like I think the main message my dad is trying to give me about dealing with racism either in the workplace or my personal life is like no stay calm use the right nice voice don't sound like an angry black person sound like a nice person if you just freeze it right away this and stay cool and whatever the problem then the problem will go away.Yeah, I also think that he believes that if there if there was really a problem that HR would respond and since they have in that means there's not really a problem.Yes, yeah.Yeah, I don't I mean I think given what I think.It my dad does not want having done whatever activism sacrifice Exedra Exedra.He does not want well and I to be in a world where we're still suffering Rachel racial Prejudice at work or school or whatever.which sure but that's notwhat does not but happening but he's very he's very he's very invested in that which for me I think asked the vulnerability of being in a particular work situation because I feel like I've been I've the coping skills.My dad taught me aren't actually helpful.And in some ways they can be almost self-destructive.And so I know that frustrates me a lot.Yeah, I think he thinks he's being supportive but I think basically he's just like well, obviously it's not a real problem or it's not a really big problem because if it was these other things would be happening.So yeah him telling me you've expressed frustrations with a lot of managers in the past.I was kind of kind of like yes in really horrible experiences.That like I don't know.I felt like he was saying I am in argumentative.recalcitrantemployee, which I don't think I am usuallyyeah, he actually did ask me if I was upset.If he said like at the beginning like this might hurt your feelings, but I think the problem is that you're is you're not diplomatic and asking that sort of thing.It was nice that he was kind of aware that this might hurt my feelings, but I think that part for my feelings.But I think the part that hurt my feelings, isn't that like?Oh, you're right.I am.I don't know I'm too or I'm too whatever.It's not that there's Behavior happy that I don't want to admit.It's more like he won't.I just feel like he doesn't I don't know.It's not he started talking about about it as this I had a personal failing which is which it's not a personal feelings and in institutional feeling.Yeah, yeah part of the thing with the Ben Franklin story is part of me thought.Oh, right, you worked in business where there are books the blah method in the blah method and 360 eval whatever but also is very much the well, here's the solution you didn't think ofI was like actually did think of trying to Pharmacy in that didn't work.Yes, I think that's yeah a part of why it's really bothering me is I definitely have a sense of myself as being able to communicate.Well, I was upset and I need to have my dad be like, nope.That thing you thought you think you're good at you're not and when I think about things I'm good at doing in a workplace.It's definitely one of them one of the big ones.I think I'm like, oh I communicate I can communicate and all right way blah blah blah.I have people and yeah.I'm just kind of like I don't know I went to Cambridge and got an honors degree in Humanities by know how to write an essay.I can I think that's what you spent a lot of money for me to learn.Yeah, I sent a message.I know I should not be threatened.But yeah.yeah the only thing that I don't do very well as public speaking but that's a really great public speaker yeah it's really weird because it's very much a to methe wakeI'm like that's not my dad just let someone else who isn't in any in any like there's a public speaker Persona sort of yeah it's just kind of like a work schmoozing Persona I mean it's still him but it's very like what just happened he's really gregarious and working the room and all these things and it's just kind of weird to me I have stage fright and he doesn't I'm kind of like all right you know I think I feel like he's seen me communicating basically all the ways except trying to do public speaking and also other people say that I'm better at it than I thinkYeah.Which I can accept maybe I don't know.I just get so nervous about it.But also it kind of feels like sort of in this like there's two sides me and Chet or management.I feel like he's kind of picking not my side which feels horrible and really weird and it's really discouraging in terms of just I try to think about how they're working hard and other places are different in other likeBut like my dad a my dad and be a person with a very different HR perspective having both these people like know the problem was you.And just makes me feel that this is a problem that just let's just not that it's going to drive me crazy until I retire.I don't know get him a car for Grant which doesn't reallyit does not make me feel great about career prospects or anything becauseI've been having this very much last four month or months with why I'm going to go to library school why I'm spending all this money and time.Almost since I'm going since I'm going to get ahead anyway, blah blah blah and it feels like it's just sort of another Community confirmation that I'm not going to exceed to succeed and not changing institutions changing Coast changing whatever having a professional degree won't help.I mean the other Prospect the other aspects someone I know asked me to contribute to a panel.She's proposing at a library conference in conference in March a thing, which was she said to talk about.Is ways in which or part of it?Is she feels like there other app?Spec's in her of her personal life and political activism and I've also helped her as a librarian sort of conceptually.He's learned all these things like making zines for 10 years in a way it ended up being a form of professional development because she knows how to XYZ is through the only in for my information about accessibility Contra my spare time.So I think a really good idea will be likewould be like yeah things I do for my off-time of relevant and important but I also get the reason I've been so I've been worried that if my co-workers or if I if it came out I don't know instead of being worried about my coworker is sort of invading my privacy online like their privacy like my personal privacy and work.I'm like God if they if I was more vocal about my clinical use at work, which I am not.Or if I was like or if I was just really like that's really racist instead of doing a huge dance around it.Not saying anything.That would negatively affect everything now.Let it go.God.Maybe I shouldn't.I know.Okay.It's been a while.I guess I'd say I'm anxious more than anything a lot.But I guess overall things are okay.So I try the first couple were really bad.So I tried to think of one and I don't believe it and it sounds horrible, but it's going to be okay things are going to like that.Sometimes it's interesting.But sometimes in my head, I'll still hear the like I hate myself immediately and I can't like but then after that I will think it's going to be okay from trying to like hopefully eventually the first one will be erased and I won't think that but it's really ingrained.SoYeah, always.It's always that and it's like a daily think if not multiple times a day.So it's going to be okay sounds like it sounds a little wishy-washy R. It sounds like the type of thing.You don't want to hear when you're upset like oh, it'll be okay almost like brushing it off, but you can be a little comforting even to just try to believe it or even just to hear it after that instead of that.They can do a little good.I didn't intentionally try them.It's just like they came into my mind.No, they weren't good.They were not good.It was like a I guess it's self critical thought I was looking at someone else.Actually they are on the team and she just looked like so put together and so and I was thinking about myself and thought of the I hate myself and then I thought she's better than me then I thought that's not good like comparing that that's not a good strategy.Then there was another one that had come into my mind actually not remembering at the moment.Right, so it's going to be okay.It's I don't know if it's that great, but it's better for sure.I think it's at least not anything negative and I find it at least triggers like a it's not the end of the world reality.Because I find the I hate myself.It doesn't just come up in the course of a day it comes up as I think about something can trigger a memory and I think back on something I did or didn't do or Saturday.I didn't say whatever and I noticed that I hate myself like comes so it's not even like if everything goes well today, I can guarantee that that's not going to come up in my mind.It's more likeMy thoughts can go there.Right, but not even just that like something will trigger some kind of memory and I'll think back and it could be years ago.It could be weeks ago.It could be something I did or something I didn't do or just something I was embarrassed.It could be a little thing.It could be like an actually significant thing and then I hate myself that will pop into my head.But it but if at least in that situation.It's going to be okay.It already happened.It's over.It's not the end of the world like soYeah, no, I definitely yeah, it takes control and it puts it all on me and it just a minute becomes like I hate myself and if I change this and like maybe then I won't hate myself so much.Maybe then the problem won't exist.Maybe then like so I definitely like it's very it's a atheme I'm seeing here is that it's very important for me to have complete control over the problem whether or not is actually related to me.And I think it's also a way to deal with shame to deal with Mike.I don't know depression or anger run an issue because I find it to be I found it to be so incredibly unproductive to get angry at the person was actually responsible.I just lied know where it is made.No progress.No success.It's been invalidated even that it's their fault, of course bringing it back and putting it on myself his felt like the only wayyeah.right and INo, it doesn't.It still feels that way though.right, and it'sIt feels like in fact if I could turn the criticism or inward a lot of the time even if it's to criticize like don't be so critical.Even if it's that it feels like that's the solution.I'm also noticing more and more lately.Maybe it's I don't know.It's a couples therapy, but it's also in general but I don't feel like I'm allowed like I'm not supposed to be critical and that's one thing but I don't feel like I'm allowed anymore to speak about the elephant in the room.To acknowledge them not to critique them not to bring them up confrontation Ali or even with like, hey, we have to talk about this eventually on top, which there's this other lawyer where Ivan's family is like by and large in denial about what's been going on and he's avoiding those topics like the plague which is I mean connected to the problem.She has a kind of stopped even talking about any of it with them because they're like so really a lot of the time doesn't feel farfetch from you to say actually, I'm the problem.And if I really didn't bring it up really didn't criticize it really did Let It Go the problems really would go away.So it's like I'm the only person in the universe who thinks that there are actually problems and until I deal with my stuff, I'm never going to have any progress and it feels that way with my parents.I mean, it feels like it feels that like it's likely more than likely my perception alone, but it feels like instead of looking for accountability in them.I need to be looking for like letting it go for myself.I used to I don't really anymore.But there comes a point where I wonder if it matters if it's true or not because it's that comes back to it's like it is with my parents.Does it matter anymore if they really were in the wrong or if I really could have taken care of things better.They're not going to change and I'm not it's like there is it almost feels like there isn't much point in coming to the like look like progress in theory for me personally to say like there are some things that are my problem and are my fault that I do need to deal with but there are also things that are not my fault and I didn't cause them andWell, and even if I had really labeled it as their problem I was never going to tell anyone.So it really was still didn't exist in my mind.I mean am I clearly supported like this isn't your fault butand I don't know if that would have served any purpose.I guess the point is more like and it feels like a very repetitive thing with Ivan.I would never feel comfortable telling a soul.Maybe it's even my fault that I'm stuck alone with that, but it just doesn't feel very good.So that's I guess I don't know how to describe it.But I'm noticing Ivan is making Improvement and he came home the other day and told me how is Bostic him aside and thanked him for stepping up and how he's been doing such a great job and he hasn't gotten any compliments or critiques from work in a while and I really happy with him.She's made a lot of progress.So that gives me hope it gives me a lot of Hope and that's really good.And he's felt more confident and he's likeOf course, I mean, of course, I would feel good and the other night I came home from volunteering and I was just really tired.And anyway, it was like dinner time and I even knew I was on my way home, but when I got home the table set and he had made dinner completely it was maybe I don't know just a little bit.He did all of that on his own.I didn't say like can you please have dinner ready by?No.I mean he really set a nice table.And he really went to effort and organized himself.And so I mean there are moments like that where he completely surprises me and then there are other times when I just feel kind of it's nothing big that's happening, but it's like he sleeps in really late and he still hasn't done the laundry and he still hasn't taken out the trash and still likeIt's not personal but it feels personal and it feels like a trigger of like the sounds so silly but it feels like it feels a little bit like my mom who would stay in bed so late.So late and who inducted me not do those things around the house.And then there are times when I know I'm always still like so I then the apartment kind of needs to be cleaned up straightened up to some extent every week.Do you want to pitch in can you do even part of the bathroom and it still.Portion of asking him to do a very small part of a bigger task that should be in this case a joint responsibility.So why is the majority of it always on me?It's like when I would clean the whole house and ask my mom if she could vacuum the stairs and she wouldn't I mean she wouldn't do it.But I know that's it sounds I guess like overreacting but it really doesn't feel that way and then it triggers me in the what about all these big problems that we're not talking about.Almost feel them.I don't know.I don't know.What a good way.It is to express it.But and couples I feel like I've been squashed kind of because I'm not we're not talking about any of the big stuff.So I feel like we spend a lot of time building communication skills talking about things like that.And that's great that's important for everything, but we're not talking about we never really talked about how much the whole thing with grad school.Actually that is an issue.And we're not talking about that.We're not talking about all the drama with his loans that he just didn't open mail for a year when I'm talkin about actually the ways in which the depression and stuff like that really is like I don't know how to say this without sounding like the worst person in the world, but some of his some of the actions that result from that or the inaction is problematic and it's not that I thought about it the other day and then my head once I finally came to a statement that clarified that I thought I was going to sound like the worst person in the world and then when I actually heard about heard it in my head I thought maybe that's not so horrible.And it was just that.I wish you wasn't depressed.I wish my mom wasn't depressed.I don't want.I don't want that and it sounds like it doesn't sound quite as horrible as I thought it would.But I just thought I hate it.I hate that.It'sit's draining, but it's all so I guess I've never even felt like I was allowed to label as depression with my mom and a lot of the times with Ivan labeling it as that is notAnd my mom never liked growing up.She never at one point explain to us what was going on with her a lot of the time it would be masked in a y Mastin Ally of physical ailment.So she was physically sick right before church every Sunday.She was fine.And then she was way too sick to go to church and it was always something Clockwork every Sunday Saturday night.She was sick and she wasn't sick and I was so angry because my mom was lying to me every single weekend and I knew she wasn't sick, but what I didn't understand was that she was struggling with Agoura agoraphobia and she was depressed when she had her own bike anxiety stuff and I likeI guess I wish I don't clearly know nothing about being a parent and I don't know whatI guess me but I don't know what it is.What is is it fair to him and expect that at any point?She would have explained what depression is or what she was dealing with or why staying in bed or staying in your PJs all day long is not instead of being really defensive about it the entire time that's not normal.I don't.I don't know again.Like I just feel even to the day.I don't feel like I can say anything about it to her.I don't feel like I can say much about it to Ivan and I feel so frustrated because no one in my family is going to say like Mom I'm worried about you you're really depressed because she'll get exceptionally angry and no one and Ivan family is going to say like, I know you're struggling with this.How's it going?Because he's not depressed.He's brilliant.He's not having anyIt is and I feel I guess I feel.Evan is sometimes made comments to the effect of like I'm not your parents.This is not me and I'll say no, you're not you're you and it makes me so angry because I get from him saying that I get the impression that I'm just overreacting and I'm projecting everything that my parents did on to him and it's so unfair and I just really need to deal with it and get over it.But in reality a lot of a lot of it is a lot the same.Yeah, and I feel like I've made a tiny bit of progress with that to some extent.I don't think by a large Ivan is not doing like he's not.I don't know.He doesn't talk about it.He doesn't really acknowledge it and I don't completely blame him for that because I mean he's I'm really the only person I meanReally the only person outside of doctor board and Doctor pharaoh who has any like who's ever going to talk with to him about it right now in anyway, and I just know the other day he got off the phone with his parents and they were finally going to like no no send the like insurance reimbursement.This is like 5 months later and I'm like Ivan.That's pretty that's a long time.And I'm like, that's kind of.rightYeah, I know and I'm like Ivan, that's not and I told him I didn't think that was okay that he could feel and he was pretty sharp with me after he got off the phone and pretty angry with me.And I said, so did you tell your parents that you felt a little frustrated about this or did you tell them how you felt about it at all?And he's like, yeah I said it was a little frustrating and I just occurred to me.Maybe it's not a coincidence that he's really angry with me after he's getting off the phone and raising his voice and maybe I didn't do anything wrong.Maybe he's really angry with them and that's okay, but I still feel really frustrated because I wishActually think it would be a really healthy thing if he could find an appropriate way to tell them that he didn't that he did feel angry or that he like that.It wasn't maybe super acceptable toI know I just it's not fair and clearly I do not have a perfect in relationship with my parents.But I guess I don't know.I wish Ivan would confront.I mean arale would confront even me he can get angry at me and yell at me to some extent which is almost likeright, and it'sSometimes it's good that comes out in a really kind of uncontrolled way because he is it's like he has no clue how to do this.How do you get angry with someone?How is that ever?Okay.I just wish maybe that he that could never happen.But I know his parents a lot of times have told him he's just being moody or he's like you just brush it off and that's just Ivan.And that's just and I guess I wish I told him it's okay to get angry and I said even if they can't handle it, even if they can't handle even if they aren't going to respond appropriately it's okay to say this is really frustrating or just to get it out to some extent.Yeah, he doesn't that's not like.It's just it's hard because I find my absolutely I find myself getting angry at them and I know there is no way he can't get angry at them and he can never say like I'm angry with my parents that would be way over the top for him.So clearly he's not going to respond to me saying that about them.He's not going to respond to that.Well, but I don't know it's hard because I want him to be able to express that and I alsoAnd I've tried to it's more I guess it's my opinion, but I tried to tell him like even if your parent it seems like his parents actually struggle with a lot of the same stuff that he does.It's not entirely like you develop these problems on his own.I think a lot of them were shown to him to some extent.So I tried to like even if like it's okay to say you're angry at your parents like they really procrastinated or whatever and it still say you love them and they're your parents and they're really important to you.It's okay to recognize that are flawed and still.Things are also just feeling I guess pretty hot right now around that subject because I was talking about visiting my parents toward the end of the summer.I really need to get my car inspected anyway, and I need to go to Louisiana.So we're talking about that and I'm just feeling like overwhelmed and I already have a mental list of projects.I want to do at my home at home and it's just really hard to talk to my parents on the phone.I'm really hard to like.My dad is trying to give me job advice and my mom is likeWe were talking about the end of August because Emma has a little bit of vacation time.So maybe taking a long weekend.Yeah, and Ivan, may or may not so that's like I'm already so worked up about that.I mean, yeah, I'll I mean I will clean to some extent obviously that's always the other day.I was just talking to her on the phone and saying like maybe will we will be coming home within a few weeks or whatever and I just casually like so how are things going at the house and because selfishly I kind of wanted to have a heads-up and what I was going to walk into because it really ranges dramatically and it's really hard to drive 8 hours and not just like walk in the door and have no reaction no matter no matter what it is.It's really hard to do that but asking is like a recipe for for disaster and she's like first thing out of her mouth was you Dad gives me no help I have to so who knows what it's likeAnd they just took in another pet so I'm really angry and really dreading it and really like I want to see my parents.I love my parents, but it's so hard to go home and not say a word about everything that's staring you in the face.So yeah, I have a list of things.I want to do it on there and it's just likethe go home and notyeahno I mean not that long butI felt really bad because my mom said I'm not sure it's as clean as your apartment and it was almost like it was an insult it wasn't like your apartment is really nice I'm not as fussy know it was an insult it's like I'm too picky I'm too even though if you're at the house is really disgusting and if I suggest that needs to be cleaned you have to have it perfect you have to have an Immaculate its again like I'm imagining the problem but Emma has suggested like it's she got really worked at the other week when we talked about it because she said she doesn't know she feels torn because they need help with things to some extent but she also just wants to spend time with them because they're getting older but also just we don't want to go home very often we don't see them very often to just actually have quality time with themsothere is one thing that my mom is already been asking about if we could help with.So she has maybe a hundred nursing uniforms.She was a nurse off and on for a while and she hasn't worked in years now.No, she probably has a hundred.I mean some of it she's never worn.Because she has a problem with shopping but she yeah, she probably has a hundred.I mean, they're all just like in there multiple huge container ship them.And so she wants to sell them.She agreed to sell them and I said, but if you want to sell them you can't go buy new if you decide that you ever want to like maybe you want to keep just a few or maybe that has to be enough, but she can't control I've learned to stop trying that but she's like, yeah, I guess we should take pictures of them and try to sell them and so part of me had like a little moment.We're mentally I thought like I wanted to almost say to her you can do that on your own.That's not my job.Using a camera or uploading to be online?That might not be the easiest or most intuitive thing for her.My mom is 66 but I just had that thought you're grown up.So your uniforms you can tell them I had that thought and I would never say that to her and clearly if we go home I will have her do it, but that's one thing she asked for so Emma said well she asked for that so we can do that, but maybe we should leave the rest of it go.Some of them are new some of them have barely been warned.I mean they're all in perfect condition.She spent a fortune on them.She might not get I mean she probably won't get half of what but better than just donating all of them.I don't want to know I don't want to know probably buy more stuff for spend it on the pets.No, it's a problem.It's an actual problem.Yes, absolutely.It's a really really it's a really big problem.She has a couple thousand bucks not like she has a lot of books how isn't that know she has a couple thousand legitimately and she keeps buying more.She reads a lot.But she has a mean of them.I don't know what percentage she's actually red.I mean she keeps buying more even ifShe goes to the library.Sometimes she says but when she came up to visit she spent more time than anything than anything.I feel like in bookstores so buy big bags of books.Yeah, yeah.So she didn't go see where Emma worked but she went to bookstores.Sorry.That's like a really rude to say about your mom.But I'm bitter about it clearly.No, she shops to it's definitely a coping mechanism for her and everybody has Mike opening my coping mechanisms are probably equally bad in two ways.But it's a frustrating thing just like they found a stray cat and now they're taking it in and I said, so what are you going to so what are you going to do about that?I just like trying to for the millionth time with them to coax like maybe just find it a really great home spend some time.And because you have 20 pets, but now I set him up and you're still in your sister's room.I'll be fine.And it's just like it's horrible because it makes me cringe inside and I should be able to let it go but it's like it's really like all that on the table.It's hard to just go home and not say anything at the house is a mess and not saying anything if they took in yet another pet.I'm not saying anything if my dad comes home at midnight from work.It's really hard.I end up right back in the child role of coaxing and cleaning and very much bargaining.I don't think so.no, she know my mom has said and my dad to some extent that they feel bad that we come home and help and I think it's just really hard for a lot of reasons because there's the whole like it's always been this way Emma and Emma and I have always cleaned it up since I mean since we were very littleit's really hard to let it go and it's also like my dad is in his late 50s.My mom is in her later 60s.It's like it's not getting to the point that even if they say there's no depression.There were no marital issues.they were there were likeof course and they have a 1616 room house.They have a big house and they have 20 pets and he has a whole business that he's the only like they really could use some help and I really and there really are some projects.That would be overwhelming for Emma and I let aloneno, but it's still it's not just it's never been just about what Emma and I needed Emma has tried to tell me like just clean your and there were times when she came home from college and she cleaned her room and she stayed in her room and she let it go and my mom would say that she was lounging on the end of spine and pretty much call her lazy because she wasn'tYes, and I don't think she ever had the idea that other people came home from college and had a break and their parents made dinner and their parents clean the house and they weren't lazy.rightlike normal amounts of helping out as opposed toso Emma has done that.Emma has suggested that we do that.She's like, you know, what instead of taking on all the projects.She's like, I know there's still some stuff in my bedroom closet.I should just stick with that if I want to go through like that.That's fine.But she's like maybe we don't need to and she said maybe we should just try to coax them to do some fun things or go out to dinner or go out kayaking with my dad because we always say we'll do that but the other there's so much but the other thing is even if we sat around the house and ignored everything which would feel impossible and probably would be impossible.my dad is not likehe's not going to take off.He's not going to get coverage while we are at home and he is on call 24/7 and he schedules a lot but he also gets a lot of emergencies and he travels and he does Alabama and La sushi ya.I mean if he comes home early, it's like 7 or 8 at night.That's so early for him.That's he let my mom will say he does that when you're home and it's like it feels like crap.And my mom will stay in her bedroom a lot, even if we are home and it's not like she doesn't care that were there and Emma says even if they're not there with us the whole time they like that were there and I think it feels good to them that we even if we don't do a ton even if it doesn't look like what a visit would look like to us.It's just it's so complicated.I mean they are in the ways that they're able my dad coming home at 7 or 8 at night.That's huge for him.usually it's 11 like usuallyyeah.No, he like work.I don't ever say that.My dad is a workaholic and that he works a lot.No, like we're talkin 7 to 11.He's gone.It doesn't happen as much on Sundays because people don't want to schedule stuff on Sundays.But I mean he's still and then it's like paperwork you should be doing paperwork.So it's like never anyway, so that's coming up in just like something I need to do it.I need to like do some personal work around that but also I got an email from my mother-in-law saying we want you to come visit August or September still make it too long like until you get there and it's so awkward because I haven't sister just got back from Europe.She was there for a year and they didn't talk for the year.I invited her.I'm like we should sky and sheNo, no, no, no, no.his sister and Ivan did notNo, they just like didn't really ever like on Thanksgiving the phone got passed around and I think he said hi to her this is it in several times.I messaged her and said like we should set up Skype or something and she just never really liked so I let it go but now she got back and I'm like so neither of you are going to acknowledge that you haven't even like talk.No, no one is going to acknowledge it no one is going toNo, no.No, I mean there's definitely tension with her and me.No, they don't fight.They just don't talk to each other.And now they want us to visit but his dad also in the same breath asked if they could visit so I'm not sure what's but I'm just like so now we were talking about when we go home to visit my parents.I've been going to a nest driving up to New Orleans for part of that time and coming back and I'm already thinking like, I don't know if I could handle everything at home and then go up there and every everything there and thenright, but 30 hours of driving andSaudi anxiety is pretty high plus I'm thinking like I cannot face any of them.If I do not have a job and I'm feeling really anxious and crummy about that.So anyway,Yes.good morning how are youyeahI don't know I'll let you finishthat sounds greatSince I ask for it back I can give it back.The day before you called them.I don't know what the order was but there is the day that we got the letter that denied the request then that day.I got a check from them.Worried about that seems over like what I had expected.How do I approve the request?Which is why it wasn't clear to me that you had communicated with them at all and that there was an error.So that's what prompted me to call them the next day.But it doesn't matter.Yeah.Or you can remove it from the check that I'm going to write you.Okay.That's a lot of money that they're giving you then.Okay, it doesn't matter.So the party was really great and my speech was really great.Can I read it to you?I wanted to memorize it but I didn't.I wanted to offer some thoughts about what a special person my dad is so as any scientist knows I'm sure most of you will certainly appreciate this after observing a system for a while.You can start to form a model to understand and explain Its Behavior.I will try to lay out a model to describe some of the unique qualities that make my dad who he is.So when I was trying to get some ideas on how to separate this complex system into its component parts actually found myself drawing some inspiration from Dad of himself.He's been building models for complex systems for most of his life.Ajooba.Tell stories of Dad's constant tickle tinkering exploring and building from a young age just this morning without my prompting him.You told me about his attempts just to build an electromagnet made out of a discarded nail and a wire when he was 8 years old and a crystal radio.And this was long before there were kids for that.Is inquisitive spirit is captured by this undergrad thesis for which he designed the model for an Innovative Harvester.Would you actually attempted to build and from my understanding most people didn't even finish their model much less attempt to build one.Do you claim for the accomplishments and potential followed him wherever he went.He Aces entry entrance exams without much preparation.And this is an exam that students now take a year or two off to study for.He graduated at age 21 and was awarded a full assistantship to study in the US in 1978.He went on to study the problems the problem of non-uniformity in tobacco seedlings for his master's thesis in studies took him to the South to study coastal plain Plains farming and then back where he continued his Winding Road and Graduate Studies to the program in operations research.His thesis was on establishing projection algorithms for specifically structured.I have nothing to say about that.He was planting the seeds for an illness lustrous and successful career and no doubt.He loves his work deeply.But most of what I want to talk about today is how my dad by his relationships.Clearly she's a brilliant man was a scholar at heart.But when you ask him about these times, you don't hear much about the finer aspects of his work.You hear about southern hospitality about his first date with my mom his lifelong fear of hiking and snakes and about his basketball games with moms brother's his involvement with the Indian studies associate Students Association.You hear about this Wilderness walks in his Friday Chinese lunches with his colleagues and community.You don't hear about how it was stressful, but I was born hours before a PhD defense you hear about how he went to the hospital gift store to buy a hairbrush for his baby daughter and how you passed out chocolate cigars to members of the defense committee after it was over.Just most of you in this room have experienced.My dad is an incredibly devoted person to experience his devotion is akin to being carried not because he takes over or assumes the responsibility or does it for you?But because of the force of his single-minded focus and wholehearted Devotion to you and the tasks at hand, really?Has a weight of an encompassing you.He takes it on as if it were his own and he takes you on as if you were his own and I'm not only talking about devotion of things that are I'm talking about scrubbing down the trash cans and I local temple every time he goes to during high schoolers in Toms River.I'm also talking about building a gorgeous wooden personalized table for each member of Mom's family and a deeply special and important part of his life hosting his weekly book club of 10 or so, which is now in its 11th year and the devotion part comes in his insisting on maintaining an elaborate tea serving ritual and he doesn't even drink tea anymore.And that's the thing.There isn't a lot of separation between mine and yours for him.He has a way of interacting with the world without a whole lot of Duality.There's not me you self other similarly.There's not a whole lot of happy or sad angry or calm frustration or fluidity.He has a share of extreme emotions, but actually he brings a good dose of equanimity to his wife in this sense dad's way is the middle way and it's great diversity adversity.Excuse me.Dad has Time After Time on the way to find Freedom in.Peace.These are all nice words about his free state of mind.But my dad is a man of action.His freedom has is really born out of a lot of discipline.His day is a series of Artful practices the daily Artful practice of meditation the daily practice of reading the New York Times allowed to his dad.They both have a voracious appetite for reading The Artful practice of a discipline workout routine followed by The Artful practice of a hot tub soak The Artful activist and preparing the morning oatmeal with the right proportion of raisins nuts and dates are full practice of just about 35 physical therapy exercises for his back neck and knees and this is just the morning.There are 20 more at night.There's alsoThe daily Artful and loving practice of being with caring for and learning from his father while this world brings out some of his most tender moments.He also uses discipline to gain freedom in this practice tohe gets no slacking doing his 35 physical therapy exercises taking his daily walk or not eating too many sweets and that always keeps his best interests in mind.This is not an easy thing for a caregiver.Not a day goes by when Dad doesn't acknowledge how much he has given him and how grateful he has to be together with him.So what's it actually like to spend time with him?Well, I'll do in this room know.This is just know this just as well as me you actually spend a lot of time laughing.He makes you smile and he really sees the humor enjoy the ups and downs the littles and The Bigs he brings a child likely to the simplest things like learning a new technique for Pomegranate seed extraction digging a hole for a new fig tree.He loves taking callsWorrying about releasing mail-order ladybugs in his garden.He was sick with in the hospital and the big one taking the time resources and energy to ensure that each member of his family can and does prepare these two new Innovative dishes for Thanksgiving.Your purchase each experience as if it were the first time with a fresh look see you spend a lot of time laughing and you spend a lot of time playing learning how to solve problems is curiosity in off of the Natural World of Bounce and his deep intuition for how things and people work makes it really rewarding to go to him with a problem.You learn how to go through adversity.You learn how to treat others and importantly you learn how to care for it and be kind and compassionate for yourself as well.So finally you can't acknowledge this great man without also acknowledging an extraordinary woman the spirit generosity devotion support and humor of my mom have helped bring out the Essences of my dad and my dad is done the same for the extraordinary qualities of my mom.So here's the both of you and may your individual strengths continue to be in service of each other and your community.It's a nice speech.I needed to say those things.I guess it came out.It came out pretty easily.I had a couple.Yeah.I had a couple of sitting sessions but I just sort of like used him as the object of focus and then I just wrote it on the day of the party.I had written down like little notes from each session and I use my grandfather and my mom for a couple of days samples.I spent a lot of time going through his master's and PhD thesis but what I really wanted to look at was his Harvester thesis as an undergrad.It's very funny, but we couldn't find it.There are some aspects of the party that were similar to my wedding for me and thatWell, some parts were really different like I was kind of a night and day the way that I was like physically not experiencing any any anxiety or tension.I mean, I was a little bit playing in front of everybody.Yeah, is there a fluid and then like once all the people showed up?I found myself stretching myself in right away.Socially, I didn't like my investment took like connecting with every single person there and it was exhausting and I felt it was really similar to what happened at the wedding, but I had the perspective to sort of I don't know take a step back andI don't know likes spent a lot of time with the same people instead of moving from group to group to group 4 hours, which is what feels natural to me and it also made a lot of sense and I was so tired after essentially like 4 days of this because I was so tired just after one day of it.It does but it wasn't obvious.Yeah.Yeah, I don't know why other people don't work harder like why it doesn't try them out.Most people.Don't float the way I do.I mean one extreme is Jeremy who had people coming up to him all evening and he was like sort of in the same general area the whole time.That's how he's comfortable.It doesn't really feel compelled to approach other people but my parents are both Social Butterflies and move from group to group.They don't seem to be exhausted from it.I think I work very hard and I like to myself alot.Yeah, like in the best most Focus way I can.So I guess I'm like I was thinking about what's going on.In other people's lives like what I can ask them about.Are people really like want to talk?It's not like I'm imposing myself.Like everybody else doesn't feel compelled to be to go around the room and talk to everybody because there are only a few people who know every person so they're like really happy to like engage in a deep meaningful conversation but to do that 25 times,What is that?I feel.Like I need to show my devotion in interest, but like people need to be reminded.But I'm not going to like approach someone and be like they're like, how are you and I'm like, I'm great.How are you great.I like what you're wearing or something.That doesn't take that much energy.Right, like I show up and I'm like, how is blah blah blah blah blah.like whatever happened tonot even that like whatever happened to your son basketball coach thing.or likeyeah, we're often people people.We're also coming up to me a lot and like a couple of my dad's colleagues like really wanted me to send them a speech which was kind of pretty cool, butYou know a lot of people were like, wow, it's so great that you still play saxophone or like I don't know there was just like compliments the entire night.And I also feel like I want to say something meaningful if I'm not just going to say thank you so much, which I did for a lot of people there's also like how did you learn?Like, how does jazz work?Did you know the tune before I hand did you practice or like how did you write your speech like what a great speech is so lucky.And I think I found myself like really trying to reach deeply and ask like, how did I write the speech?I don't know.I sort of like.A whole lot about it.I didn't write much until today and I don't know it's like this whole building the wheel every time or most people seem to recycle a lot more.What does scrupulously mean?Yeah, I got like stuck in that mode.I can't pull myself out and zone out.Or like go back to where I'm just like sitting.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I think I realized it kind of a lot later.They don't.We don't show their devotion in the same way.Like they're not trying to make a deep connection with everybody every single time.They talk to someone that's my own way.But I think like in the spirit ofLike in what kind of spirit and bringing to it?If you're not sort of touching your mouth when you offer a suggestion or a or an interpretation your hand goes to your mouth.You have to feel unconscious about it now.But it happens.It's like that's your position for like I made an offer and let's do that.I found out more about my very early relationship with the oldest female cousin.She was there.First of all, my parents think that it was a matter of a couple of days that I was really really sad and gloomy.I saw remember as feeling like a couple of weeks, but I'm sure they're right.They said that the write-up was extremely painful that was like the worst of it where it was like the transition like I'm being like all my connections are being like cut off completely torn away from me, but that wasn't but that was when I was quite a bit older when I was a few months old her family lived in Virginia at that time, and we would spend many weekends there especially during this time that my mom was from what I understand now very depressed and it was very hard for her.Yeah, just moved.My dad had justjust defended.I was three weeks old when they moved and then my mom had never lived away from home and had this new daughter and was like totally depressed for about a year.This is part of my questioning to her like why like she brings it in a way that doesn't focus on the feelings.It's like it focuses on explaining why she was feeling bad.And then what she did she couldn't really do much.It was like she was away from home.My dad was gone.I was like crying all of the time her parents were very preoccupied my grandpa.My grandfather had started a business like as a second career that completely failed and they were losing a lot of money so she couldn'tThe business I think it was like a mark some kind of Bodega.Is an entomologist.He was teaching also but I think he's always had an interest in business, but I don't think he had it doesn't sound like he was a very fruitful venture.So they could have talked on the phone and her sister lived like an hour and a half away.So I think that was really important for her to get through.Yeah, I think he was probably working at least it was an hour commute.She was probably gone at least 9 hours of the day.I meanI don't know.I don't know what his hours were.Okay.Sorry, like got really obsessed with finding my dad's undergraduate dissertation.Yeah, so I was like looking at the University's web archives.And anyway in the process, I found out that I can look at anybody's dissertation in the whole world and I spent a bunch of time reading yours.I had to disclose that.Well, okay, so I was like writing the speech and I wasn't really reading it for the content.I was reading it for negative deep inside about your personality.In your life and there wasn't really a lot of those.I wonder what my mom infant mother died on the nature of our diet was when I was an infant.It sounds like it falls more until she was withdrawn and I wasspicy rather than her being intrusive in my being whatever.Yeah avoidant just from like what I have heard about what she was going through in that time.And I wonder if she hated me.This is all in the context of what I read.So we would go to her sister's house and Selma was like 9 and apparently she would just like pick me up out of her car seat like strep miadora hip and carry me like that for the entire weekend.She would go from place to place to place and I was like, I was really like her doll.We were inseparable and she was completely adoring and loving and like needed and wanted me to just go everywhere with her.It wasn't like she necessarily played a whole lot with me, but just had me with her everywhere.This was I think many weekends of that first year.I think she was probably one of them.I think relative to the rest of her life.This was the darkest time for her.But it doesn't sound like there is anything outstanding about how she treated me or how she interacted with me.I don't know.Yeah, I was just thinking about that, too.Yeah, I really do feel that way.I don't know what I would lose.I guess I would.Waste minutes.Like I do feel kind of an urgency here.That I have to fill up all of the time.But if I'm choosing not to that's it should be really important to me.how to lose the chance to show you how committed I amor how special you should think I am.But I don't feel that extra layer of filtering or sensor in here.It doesn't feel like I don't feel like I'mPlanning or scheming or anything?It just feels like whatever I have at this time, like should be yours in such a way that you really see who I am and appreciate it and love it.I know I understand.What you're saying?I don't know.I don't know how it happened differently.I think I get why it feels so scary to not want to try and general and why it feels like that's going to be the end of the world if I fall into.A space where I'm not feeling connected.I'm not feelingMomentum or like not trying.And I think I do fall into that space and it's very bad and scary and I'm not accepting it as much as I accept the other mode.What's the alternative?No, I don't.I can't imagine a model of the alternative.I think I have to make it.Like figure out what the model is for me.What?You don't have to think about it at all.Bye.Good morning.I woke up 10 minutes before my alarm went off this morning, which I always sort of like but sort of hate because I'd like to sleep that extra 10 minutes.James is not doing so well.I don't really know what he like went out for a walk last night late and got back later.And I said, is there anything I can do and he said probably not and then that was that there's isn't anything I can do.I don't know where to start.I don't know whether like I don't know whether at any given moment.I don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing or the wrong thing and whether I'm helping him or hurting him.It's like anything I do.I feel like we just don't trust each other right now.We were watching Lewis.We watch it like Tuesday's less than a week.It's only 20 minutes episodes.There was an episode last night of a guy who's a very old friend of Lewis comes into town and basically takes Louis out and then tells him he's going to kill himself until like we saw it was about suicide like on the blur James was like I'm so we didn't watch it one night.Then the next night.It was like do you want to skip it and he was like, what about you I'm fine and I was like, but let's watch it.It wasn't very it just wasn't great.I don't know.It just didn't go anywhere and it didn't feel inauthentic to me.I just felt like the show's writers.Didn't know what they were trying to say.I don't know.I mean, it's like I don't really know because I can't talk to him about it.I feel like James is just afraid that he's going to come back one day and I will have killed myself, but you know, I can see why one would not trust me to give in that and I can't promise him that I won't I'm trying but IWe went out for a drink after church.I guess two weeks ago.Now are we going to have with the regulars from church and at the very end of the evening, everyone was like like an hour at the very end of the conversation.One of them was like a psychologist.I think his ordained in the church also, but I'm considering him a psychologist somehow by calling like getting calls from him like emergency calls from his patient came up.I'm like what he said was like well if they're calling me they don't want to die, but they're still suicidal and everyone was like, huh?Yeah, but I don't want to say anything.I'm not quite sure why I thought of that this was the same to evening wear another of the people.I was hanging out with worked at Frederick.So it was kind of a weird evening in that.I don't know fortunately nobody was that interested in listening to me.Like I was part of the conversation, but nobody was relying on you to lead it.It was easier than it might have been I didn't have to take a stand or anyting.Yeah, it could have been much more comfortable than it was.I think I'm doing better but it doesn't seem fair to you to make promises like that.I can't I don't like remember not being able to talk to James about something like that was important in my life before I just neverEven like Falling In Love With Another Man was something I could talk to James about.It's like I'm really used to thinking that most things are my fault.So it's like I don't even notice it anymore.It's just like a baseline assumption until like I start thinking that things would just be better if I were part of the equation, but that's exactly the problem right now.Like the fact that I think that is what what is problematic.I don't know if that makes sense.So driving into one of the events.I think it was like the brunch on Sunday because it was the one that got heated.I remember just sitting there very clearly and thinking this is because of something I did.This is my fault and like I think I remember that most I think I remember that most because it was so clear that it was really not my fault at all.Like it was not anything I did or anything I could have done to prevent it.So yeah fairly self-centered.I feel like James is having a rough time and maybe it's because of me maybe it's not but I feel like it must not it must be because of me and it is incumbent on me to fix unlike.I know those things aren't true, but I just can't handle it.Yeah, I guess I'm in sort of a double bind where I worried that if I talk about constantly thinking that everything is my fault.You will think that it's very selfish and irrational of her and if I don't talk about it, you will say don't you realize that everything is your fault?so sort of factI think about this with regard to my depression and how do you categorize depression a mental illness and like implicit?Unclear and people keep telling me it's not my fault.But they also keep telling me that it's my responsibility to change it.So I don't really know.I don't know how those two are in conflict with each other.James keeps telling me that it's not my fault that he's really pissed at me for for it all the same time so I don'tI don't know.I don't really remember this but I wrote about it a long time ago.There was a point in the hospital where the Doctor Who had been there basically a long time and all my third or fourth or fifth visit and basically he was like you need to work harder.You just need to work harder to feel better and it was like, I don't know what to do.I can't exactly say they were wrong.If it pissed me off enough that they will what I decided to do at the time was like well fuck it.I'll just get better enough to go home.And then next time I'll just kill myself.That's what I'll do, but then I got better enough to go home and I didn't tell myself.So that was good, but I don't want people start saying but that to me, how do I I just think that well, that's why that's what they've been thinking all this time.And I don't know.I don't really have a clear handle on what I'm talking about even here.I'm trying not to forget that.I don't know if that last is true.I feel like it happens often enough that I will say.I'm angry at this other person and you're going to say well maybe you're also angry at me and I say I don't know and then like right now I'm sort of angry with the mental health care, and I don't know how to say that andnot have you interpret that as I'm really angry at you.I don't mean to.I guess I should try harder like that.No, I think I was.Telling you that I didn't know how to say that as angry as somebody with.I was immediately after saying that is when I started to panic.I don't know.Yeah.Yeah, it does feel like one of the worst things in the world.I didn't know think that I felt like that.I have a hard time telling you that I think you're wrong increasingly like that.Well, because I think it's like, you know the longer we work together the more you end up being right?I don't know.I don't like not relying on my own judgment.I feel really uncomfortable with that like saying like I don't see how this is, right, but from experience I should probably sit with it for a while and see it's actually very scary to talk to you about this.I feel like historically when I've trusted other people's judgment over my own it's ended badly for me.And I don't I really don't think that that is what you're asking me to do to be clear.I really don't think that I but there's always somebody asking me to do that.Yeah a little bit because then if it ends badly for me, it's like I'mit is very scary Community to let to let me know that I trust you that that much because clearly you're with me like that's just going to happen.So there you have it.I don't understand.I don't know.I mean, I certainly feel like it's not like it's eventually not going to be okay for it to be about what I need, but I don't know if that's the same thing as what you're saying.Yeah.Yeah, I just thought this is not going to end well.I guess also the way that our conversations go and we talked for a long time.And this is going on and I sort of say well that makes sense or like no that doesn't feel right.But like I don't know I worry about I just worry about being wrong.And I know that I probably don't need to but I do.And even like do re last or something.Okay.I'm not doing so well.Yeah, extremely sad.I'm getting ready for a job conference in a couple of days going to go hopefully have interviews.It'sdoes it teach me teacher placement agency called?They have conferences, you know, both Regional and kind of national.So this is for the national one and that's coming up on the 15th how I need to go to school.I'm not really entirely sure what I should be doing.I'm hoping for the best.I'm hoping for the best.To me.I feel like I have teaching experience.I have a master's degree.I'm really good.Like I'm a really really good teacher.But it doesn't mean very much.Yeah, I don't know.Yeah, I'd like when it doesn't make very much difference in terms of what my chances are of getting a job.Yeah, I don't know about that.Then I have to see if the schools if they want to hire me.I'm unsure also aware.I'm going to be applying or where I should be applying and I don't.Play basically just applied at the area.Do I Go Everywhere?I don't know.My friend Candice was just visiting.Yeah.Yeah, I don't know what to do.Yeah.I don't know what to say.Yeah.ahaYeah, and I'm just barely.Something like that.I just felt sad.I don't know how to function.I guess.I don't know.I guess about the same very tired.apparently difficultYeah.Or maybe I just don't have anything to say yet.I know.I do feel beat.I just feel like I've been repeatedly punched in the jaw like beat up just tired.I justokayyeahYeah now I remember that.That makes sense.That's for sure.Yeah.About the same.I made it through it.Yeah, I'm struggling.I'm sorry.yesterdayTurn around Mike.No, they weren't so bad.That's fine.Okay.Hi.Ran into he's real nice.Okay.It doesn't matter.It really doesn't.Yeah, I mean, well, I guess it matters a little bit like he sort of makes me cry, but it doesn't I don't care.I don't know.Yeah, I really wish it didn't matter.Yeah, he's a really great person.Yeah, I don't know.I really really wish it didn't.Or yeah.Yeah, sort of.Yeah, I sort of just feel like a mess.I mean their stuff to do with hardware and that comes up all the time.So it's not like I feel like I'm constantly have school stuff coming up.I hate that.I don't know.Yeah, I'm sorry.I amyeah, I don't.Kind of like know what to talk about.Talk about everything.careI justI guess.the you know, Iwant to talk aboutsorry, I guess.I find myself.I just never mind.Sorry.I guess it's okay for me to talk about this.just thinking aboutthe way this all gets put in put into place.Yeah, I I'm sorry.Yeah.Yeah, that feels about right.Yeah.Yes.I don't know.I guess I feel that way.But still I'm just not there.That's what's striking.I just feel like I'm never quite there.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.How do you make?Okay.Yeah, I think that sounds like it.I don't know.Yeah, I mean.Seems like a real unclear don't they?Yeah.Yes, yeah.Yeah.No, I think I agree with you there.I don't know what to do about it.Yeah.Yes, yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I haven't been cutting.I'm not sure that I'm feeling at my low space but often so it's fine.Yeah.Yeah, but I haven't I've been with James so I think okay.Yeah, I think so.I haven't been thinking much about suicide but Iyeah.Yeah.Not as much.But yeah.Yeah, and yeah, I'm okay.I don't think so.Okay.Yes.I think she wanted to know for about it.I sent her a kind of pretty detailed outline of what happened to me.It was pretty hard.I'm assuming it was okay for her to call you.Yeah.Yeah, so for but I like long-term Subs like she's doing in the spring and apply for anything yesterday or yesterday because the sense of Doom was a little bit too overpowering when I'm sure that I think it's a job that if I do get the job.I'm going to fail at it.I'm usually not I'm not usually the best time for me to fill out the application.Yeah, I think I'm getting on James's nurse.I don't know.I think he expects or wants me to or thinks I have kind of control over this that I sort of think I should have also.I don't know what I think he has now.I think I have to have but I don't think that I am not sure that I do.Yeah.Then I feel like a prisoner in my life.But then second guess all of this.You know, how much is how much of it is?I don't actually want to die and I'm in so I'm looking for an excuse to stick around.So it's just that I don't know how much of myResentment against James for being the person who he wants me to be here is real.Does that help at all?You know that I don't hurt myself because James doesn't want me to because I feel like I have responsibilities towards him, but I don't know how much of that is real and how much of that I'm really actuallyyeah, it doesn't matter butI feel like such a coward like different but I can't do anything.I'm not doing anything to make it different, you know, and then I wonder how much of that is me in just not wanting to feel like I'm totally out of control a lot of navigating.A lot of navigating in the last day or not actually more than you not actually more than usual a lot of if I make it.Yeah, but I'm pretty resentful of him.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yeah, I can't just accept that it that's how it feels.I have to second-guess it but that is how it feels.Haven't thought about it in those terms.It's funny.I'm not angry at you, which I find interested.Also interesting that one of the reasons.I'm not angry at you is because I don't think you care all that much and it's kind of a stance that I needed to get it to release.honestly, and I they don't feel like you are personally invested in me that the way James is personally invested in me or like the other people that take care of me, you know, maybe I just need to have somebody that I'm not not angry atpretty angry at myself pretty angry at the most people in my life.Yeah, I'm not sure what or why.seamlessYeah, you're pretty careful not to take a side.No, I was just thinking about that last night and I was thinking about being angry and was kind of thinking about not being angry with you and trying to find out why that was.So maybe but it feels like it was more like a natural correction.Yeah, it would be much harder.I feel like I am like both James and I are blackmailing one another with caring about each other.I feel like sometimes I'm coercing him into you know, bending over backwards to take care of me and I feel like he's somehow coercing me into sticking around.Yes, James is very upset and he doesn't feel like he's allowed to be upset because it upsets me so much and to some extent.No, he's not.It does not it does upset me too much unless it's not a tenable position for us to be in.I feel like I am working just as hard as he is.I'm working that in that state has his way rather than an in an active heart of Deceit, you know.Fruits of my work are I am still here or I'm dirt hindering or whatever and I'm a little resentful of the fact that it's hard to see that's that that's really hard.Yeah, go into work.Not in the last World is but before that.Yeah, yeah and a part of me really just wants him to say it's okay do what you need to do.But like he's not going to going to say that.Northshore tea, but that's not really the most important thought in my head.Or even assured or that not going to work.Been riding a lot and I don't know to some extent it seems helpful and to some extent it seems like it gets me worked up.Which again makes me feel like maybe I ought to have control over it and don't or maybe I do have control over it and I'm just choosing to be like this.I do.Yeah, James last night and one of those things he said was he doesn't feel like I should be able to be filled.Where is that?I don't feel or not feel the way.I feel like he doesn't understand why I don't cry why I don't get upset when I get upset.But it's like I can't except when I have to and then it's really really bad.Memories We haveYeah, right now I'm a little more Angry, you know, it's early in the morning.So I'm not feeling that much of anything.I'm so angry with myself.I keep thinking like what is this anger doing for me not getting very far with that.Could I should be able to see a way out of this but I should be able to to do something more active.I don't know what I'm doing.I should be able to to just cope and go to work and I should be able to kill myself or I should be able to find some other option.I feel like my existence is hurting people I love but that if I left I would hurt them more.I feel like I'm not good for much.I'm not like I don't have anything to offer.Yeah, what I really want to do is just sit around and read books, you know, and sometimes when I'm going to bed or I can kind of snap into a mindset from where I can change things and I can make a change in my life and feel okay about where I am when I feel really bad and I just can't get there.I can't remember any of the things that used to be comforting.Yeah.That's about right.There are things that it's important to other people that I be able to do.So there's a reason I should be able to do them.And I just can't I can't but then I wonder is it just is it just that I'm not organized enough for that?I'm not willing to hurt enough.Maybe I couldYeah, I feel like I did that all if I did that all the time I never be able to do anything.I was cleared to work a month ago.Maybe I was already thinking that turn up.So it feels like with things like work, it feels like I say to people okay, this is hard.This is getting pretty hard.Maybe this is too hard for me and they say no you have to do it and I say, okay, I'll try to do it but this is I don't think I can do this.This is too hard and I just mean while you know continue to do it and they say no there's a choice you have to do it and but eventually I just drop everything you say.No really like I'm going to die.I can't do this and they say why didn't you say soIt's not like I don't complain.Don't I don't know how to hit the right note to let people know that.I'm really serious that it'syeah.Maybe that's because I do do it well to the point where I just can't do it anymore at all.So why couldn't I just do it a little less well.It's a part of it.I need to be done.I don't I don't know what's going to happen.I don't like it.But you know, maybe I don't absolutely absolutely need to be done.But I need to be done enough that maybe she's not to fuck around with.And you know, I'll probably give two weeks notice because that seems like the fair thing to do think maybe say I can work up until Christmas Eve, you know, I was going to have a week off after there anyway.I didn't know it just feels like something I have to do.So, you know, I feel like I can work the rest of this week because I am only working two days this week.Yeah, I don't know so much of what I do.I think I can't do until I do it.So I think probably yes.I can probably do it.I just feel so bad.I just got a job.I don't know.What's wrong.Running around for 8 hours.Yeah.Yeah hard to believe it's hard to have to feel like by everyday.It's hard to police myself that for 8 hours.It's partly that.That thought had crossed my mind.Yes.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I worried that I'll need to be hospitalized again.In other ways like I can but it's just a holding pattern and I don't know who my would be would pretty much be.I don't know who would run into.I don't know who would run into, you know, like if I had to be hospitalized this weekend, it would be a lot harder for me to say, you know, I think we're doing the right thing.Yeah, and I worried I won't be able to handle that.How do you mean?Yeah, it feels like Starbucks and this are conflicting in some ways.I can things that make me go to my job.They're the things that make me shut down here or to upset to deal with anything.I feel like this is more important.Yeah, I pretty much don't entertain it because it's painful would be impossible without it.So then it seems like an impossible to do.I don't know what to do other than this.Yeah, I kind of keep saying to myself.This is the shortcut.Just got to keep working.yeah, it was kind of like it was going to be just the way just way too complicated and expensive and you might have to take like state exam and it doesn't seem like a good idea every state requires that you pee pee and thenbut like the one that everybody takeslike most of them required some sort of State exam and then they all require like pretty high application fee andit yeah in like I yeah.They all require like the degree and then 1500 hours of time.Supervise, which seemed to be about the same everywhere.Okay.So it's like somewhere between 3 and $600.Which seemed a lot to me?Four everywhere except Virginia shockingly enough.Yeah.Thanks.Yeah.Thank you.Yeah, me too.Thank you for doing that.Yeah, and it was because it seems like three came back a little early early yesterday.He said it did pass the budget and was like, okay.I'm never going to do anything for a while.Yeah, thanks.Yeah.I don't have to yeah, although it's you know, my sister-in-law.I don't think we're ever going to be kindred spirits.I've grown to really love and appreciate them.And also they're just a divided like I don't know.We just don't have we don't think anything else anything alike?Yeah.Which is higher do you know, especially like the older sister Vivian is we actually do have a lot of the same interest in common which is really feel really sad whenever we talk about them.She was an English teacher also and like loves literature but doesn't love any of the same literature that I do in like Yeah from my perspective doesn't think about it terribly analyticallyand I feel guilty for thinking that way but we like talk about the and Jessica.Will not stop giving me advice which I don't it drives me nuts, you know in some ways like she's probably should give me advice at this point advice about the kids.You know, she's got a two year old who is hilarious?Putting her stuff draft in timeout and why are you putting Gigi in timeout?Because she said bitch.Do we say bitch know we don't that's Mommy.That's mommy and daddy's word.Yeah, which is I think a pretty good way to deal with swearing and kids, you know, like that's just not your word.James and I had a pretty big fight in the other the other night, which was good.I it helped us talk more about not being where we wanted to be together.You know, I think to be someone who I can talk to anymore, which that's a bad thing.So.So from James's perspective, I think it's like he doesn't really talk to me about his work anymore.He hasn't been talking to me about this, you know the process of figuring out what to do next very much.I think you know, I think there was a long time where I just really wasn't able to have a conversation.That's what it feels like to him.I think he's worried about that.He's been very in the habit of not bothering me with the logistics or not asking me to help deal with the logistics.It's you know, or that it will be too much for me for me.I feel likeI can't tell whether I'm more sensitive than usual or whether James is more dismissive than usual.I feel like when.I also can't tell whether it's just like I need to be right more than usual or he's being were the mint than usual and telling that I'm wrong all the time, but it's just likeI feel like when I try to talk to him about things and that I worried about like I feel like my feelings end up getting hurt a lot.Yeah.Yeah, I guess the summation of our fight would be James day.And you know, I'm so angry at you because you left me and I'm really glad that you didn't kill yourself, but that's a pretty tough minimums day.Like it's not a great minimum and me saying, you know, I feel like I deserve a medal for not killing myself.So I'm feeling pretty good about that.Yeah.I'm so worried about the point where I'm thinking.Well, okay, if he's going to continue to get angry about get angry about me in about this I needyou know he needs to look for ways I could make it betterbut I feel like I'm just doing everything that I can to make things better I'm not I mean I'm not everything yet not everything I can but everything I can think of and can handle you know it's like he's been very clear we've both been very clear that the waythat I can take care of us as a couple right now is to take care of myself and that's what I'm doing and I don't know what to do I want to be enough some suggestions as to what to do nextI don't think he's glad to be married to me at this point.And I don't know how to say how to handle that certainly thinking and sort of cautiously saying we need to get back into marriage counseling and I'm like no.No this really needs to happen.Like I need to make this happen.Yeah, he is.Yeah.awesomeYeah, I think James gets along very well with her.I think it would make him feel more comfortable to.You know, like I'm angry at him for it's hard to hold on to being angry.I'm having a hard time talking to you about this, which actually talk to you about it.Yeah, I feel like I don't want to tell tell you about James disappoint James his disappointment anger with me because you might catch it.Or you might take my side over his and that that might be almost as bad.We had a conversation earlier that day about kind of cost and I was thinking that sounds like someone had roof for like there that people thought that like the hypomania coming from bipolar II thought it was a real gift and they're like, oh, haha.That's really sad.I'm like, I don't know.I think it might actually be a pastoral gift.oh, this is like from this is kind ofkind of the setup for this conversation.Yes, or they were saying that they did not think that it was a gift or they were like, no, it's just bad and I was kind of like well, I don't know for like her romantic.The time are a time of like intense work and where she does really good work.I don't think it's worth the price.I think she should get the treatment for it.Like I don't know that doesn't mean you can't use the things that come with these horrible things that happened to you.James and I kind of talked around that for a while and around like the idea that you know, you end up paying pretty much every gift in some way or another that's how the world Works in.So then like that conversation have been done like at the end of the night it was it was very late.And I you know made some reference to my being she was like well every guess if every gift comes with a price and it really really hurt my feelings a lot.I'm not sure why I should likeYou know, his attitude was I'm not going to tell you that things are good when?They are good.My attitude was I don't want you to I just don't want you to tell me that things are bad at midnight when I'm about to go to bed, and I've had a good day.I know it's been I know it's been hard being married to me.I really know that like I would see that maybe I say that I'm surprised or say that I don't know why it hurts because I don't think it ought ought to I don't think I should let myself get hurt by it.It does feel.I guess I felt like not reacting correctly or not interpreting correctly.I feel like or I feel like I should be okay with having.Yeah, I mean, I know he's not glad to be married to me because I asked him.Which I feel like my beware.The the communication between us is always upset with him for answering the question.I'm already upset with him for answering the question.Yeah.Yeah, but like I asked him it because because of what he had said.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, something like that.Okay, it's taking me a long time to process things.I didn't know.I think it's I think that it's a little different I think so.Yeah, I think that I'm worrying that you will agree with him in that, you know being angry and be disappointed with me about the depression that would that would just be hard like I think that they're different coming from different places like it's IYeah, I think one one hand.I I very much want to take care of James.So maybe I just feel like if you take my side then I think like I've been spoiled to tell you about this, but then it's like he's been angry at me or maybe I'm just worried that if I tell you about it, you will show that you have been angry at me before but yeah, I guess you've got a point.Yeah.Yeah.I guess I would feel like by you telling me about this fight that we had and going to that kind of criticism.I would have betrayed James and some way.Yeah, yeah, I guess so.Yeah.Yeah.The heat index is 105.Yeah.I was there Monday.I was there Monday.Yeah, it's good.I know some like Facebook I sent out an email whatever whatever, you know, I've got an interest, you know, so we'll see so far so good.I'm going to try to do like a weekly blog, you know that way.So yeah, it's good.I mean it felt good.I was there Monday and it feel like I don't know.I just got comfortable or so weird, but I don't know.Yeah, it's cool.I mean it's going to take time but the fact that I've already gotten some feedback interest questions, you know, it's really good my friend Penny, so I didn't know it was some kind of life coach.She does like wellness her diet, or I don't know what she does but she got in touch with me.She's like, you know, we could totally work together.Like I will refer you to people probably so that's good so far.Yeah, the woman at the Museum where I had my event that Assyrian Museum the director son.I guess he's like 17 17 18.I guess he has like a DD issues or I'm not sure exactly what but she got in touch with me just like, you know, I don't know if there's something you think you could I was like that depends.I don't know how serious it is.But yeah, I don't know.So meanwhile I decided just to just kind of start like I looked into programs courses because I can't afford it, you know right now, but honestly, like I've just been watching YouTube all those lectures are on their, you know intro to psycho-analysis, you know methods of psychotherapy, you know watching thoseUse me.Think you looking at their syllabi and I'm going to buy some of the books, you know, I might as well just at least educate myself, you know, I don't know neither mean I'm smart enough to figure out some of the basics until I can actually, you know, take an actually it'll help me that way, you know.I won't feel like I'm playing catch-up with the with psychology Majors.So yeah doing that then I decided what I'm going to do is start a non-profit, you know, the writing remember I was saying why don't I just do poetry workshops.Yeah.I'm going to do that.But here's the trick.I'm going to create a nonprofit that way that way it's not just some poet trying to make money for her.Yeah, because you know nonprofit to make money.They just have to be for a specific purpose or cause or whatever.So what I'm going to do is a non-profit where you know, I'm going to be going to pay myself or whatever we do these workshops whatever but then a portion always goes to like a local literacy things, you know, anything that has to do with like literacy books for schools.Anything that has to do with like writing books literacy do that because I've been researching that and it's fucking ridiculous and I seen some like writer workshops.There's one in San Diego.That's a nonprofit.It's called San Diego.Really nice website.I mean the people that are doing it they're fucking kids for Christ's sake it's not like they can't do it.But I mean that means that I can definitely do it.I mean they're charging like 495 for like a 10-day.I mean come on.So yeah, so I'm going to do that.So I figured between that and this, you know, just a year maybe whatever just kind of really works at it.Maybe it'll start you know, so yeah.Yeah, I do.Like I feel like these two things are very doable.Yeah, I think that's what it is.I feel like wow, I'm doing things like I'm it's an incredible feeling to do your own things.Do you know what I mean?It's like wow.Yeah.I yeah, it's a great feeling to be it.Is that kind of slightly entrepreneurial, you know, it feels great to Just Be Your Own Boss and you know not answer to anybody but yourself, you know, but also do things that I don't feel half asked about you know what I mean?I don't have that foggy feeling where I'm just kind of just getting sucked along into some pass it I'm only got about halfway through or something, you know, so yeah, that's a very nice feeling.I mean that's you know, I don't know and then that grow Luma is here from Delaware.She's here till tomorrow she came to visit and it was cool.I mean, you know, I don't know what to make of her.It's very interesting like yesterday.I think because it's very genuine with her.I was almost like I was feeling very sexual.I don't know.I'm assuming it was bad.Maybe it was like that part of me was like because this feels so real I'm not going to get you know, just shut down or something.I guess.I don't know.Well like yesterday, wait what?My sense of why because it's like it's not just a sexual thing.It's a real, you know, there's a lot of depth to it.So maybe because of that, you know, there's something I don't know but the things we talked about and you know, it was great.I was very honest.I just told her because I mean we were in a hotel I didn't want to I don't like those awkward.I don't want her to wonder like why isn't he making a move or what?You know what I mean?Yeah, so, you know, we're just laying there very comfy or whatever, you know, we were kissing and stuff and I just told her I was like, you know, I'm sorry like I've been a little bit and it is true.I mean I've been feeling way less sexual, you know.I think I mentioned it in here.Yeah, and I was like, you know, it's just I literally am in a very good way.I'm having trouble shutting off my mind about all these things.I'm doing, you know, I mean, that's just a fact I can't I'm constantly thinking now about business and now about this writing like I'm just you know, so I was just telling her, you know, some of that and some of just I'm not I'm just going through so many changes or something.I don't know.I just feel less it's not a bad thing.I think it's a very healthy thing.I'm just wondering if that's also maybe a little part of it.I don't know.You know what I mean?Because obviously I've been having not often but I've hooked up with you know, I think it's just because it's functional.You know what I mean?I don't really have to hang out with them.I don't really have to invest anything other than just having sex really and some chit chat.SoYeah, yeah, so that way I don't have to feel like I'm going on a limb or vulnerable are this or that are like, oh my God.It's a relationship.I don't know.No, no, what was her?It's like we definitely have a real connection and she's you know, she's like a classy chick, you know, I mean, I don't know how to like she we've done that.We you know, but it's not about that.You know what I mean?This is a real thing, you know girls coming all the way here from Delaware.I mean, you knowexactlyExactly.Exactly.Yeah part of his also maybe self.I don't know not so protected.I mean she doesn't live around.I mean, I think we're both kind of trying to figure out we talked about that last night.It was very honest like she's like, do you ever wonder like what the hell were doing?Like we just talked I was like, yeah I do but I was like, I guess I don't think about it too much because I figure it is what it is.And we enjoy each other's company.We both have a lot going I said in some ways.Honestly, it's kind of perfect, you know, so I was like quite frankly.I'm really just enjoying spending a lot of time alone.I don't see a lot of my friends very often.I've got a little routine.I just need a couple of my Assyrian friends.I do this, you know and other times I'm just really focused on continuing to improve things.You know, that's causing me to want to be alone a lot.You know, I'm having less patience just hang around and like make conversation, you know.I think it's great.It's not in a bad way.And that's what I told her I said.exactlyYeah, and this was the first time I told the women that very like honestly I just told her I was like, you know in the past I'd always want to be hanging out with people I needed stuff to do sitting rice every way wise.I was like, you know, it was just all folett all filler, you know, it was just all yeah and I was like now I could care less.I look forward to going home and being with Cecilia and cranking up next Netflix and just cruising the internet doing my research.You know, I'm up at like 1 in the morning looking up nonprofits.Like how should I do that?How do I do that?How do I register that or for the business?Am I supposed to be an LLC?Should I you know, what am I supposed to do?There's that someone who's not thinking about boobs, you know in a way it's just become a functional thing.It's not that I don't want to have sex.I don't she's not that kind of girl.I don't want that thing with her, you know what I mean?And she's totally I mean she was like, you know, we're very similar just like I've gone through a lot of that to blah blah blah blah blah.And also I told her I was like, you know, so you lost your dad, you know, so I do want to be like, I think it's good the way we were just not there's no pressure.There's no we have a great time.Enjoy.We don't we enjoy we don't put pressure on each other in anyway.I was like, you know, I know what it's like you lost your dad and even though you're very healthy you're handling things really well, but I also know that the first few years are very, you know,Can be handling it.Well, then suddenly for a month.You're not or whatever.I mean, I just takes a long time so.Over a year ago.Yeah pretty recent.Yeah, but I mean she's very grounded.She's a very overall like very together mature cool person, you know anyway so so yeah, but yeah, like I can't lie though.I mean I do kind of like it's weird like I'm almost looking forward to she she's leaving tomorrow so I can just go back to my routine.You know, it's like that's just the way I feel right now, you know, and I haven't told her that, analogy, you know, and it really is like that.I think that's part of it too.It's like if you just fucking woke out of a coma woke up after 20 something years and you probably are going to want a lot of time to just you know, you know what I mean?I I need my personal space and like, you know, I just want to be I don't want to be alone all the time but a lot of the time I want to be alone.I do I guess.I don't know.They're kind of they butt heads.I don't know.Exactly.Yeah.Yeah, and also that I mean I told her this too I was like, you know now I'm playing catch-up except now, it feels really healthy catch up.You know what I mean?Now?I just feel like I'm just fucking focused.So you know what?I just don't I don't know.I'd rather be focusing on that evenYeah, exactly.Like it's not calibrated yet.You know what?I mean right now.I'm just focused.Yeah, right.Now I'm just focused on making shit happen because I feel like it's long overdue.So that part of me just won't let it go.Like I can't it's not that I can't relax.It's a good thing.Like I'm just you know, I'm excited about things and I just want to see results.I just want to get it going, you know, and I think you have to be that way.I think any people that start to work for themselves.That's 24/7 a lot of times.They're just that's what they're focused on, you know, and especially someone like me I've been pain top, you know exerting energy and all these things likeJust you know what?I mean like to finally be focused do Lucid have things that I know are absolutely doable and feasible, you know, that's huge for me.You know what I mean?So it's like I just want to it's like I'm savoring it almost you know, I think the other thing too, I realized you know yesterday there was that I don't know if it's now they're saying it might be a hoax.I don't know there was that story about the 8 year old girl.There's some story about an eight-year-old girl in the Middle East who is married off to a 40 year old dude and on her wedding night.She died from an internal sexual things.I was fucking I mean everybody was fucking outraged but I mean I was just you know, but you know, I started thinking about why am I not why am I so outraged but like I started realizing something else and this is maybe why I'm not married also like why I feel like I do have some of my uncle's like I think I've always felt like I'm meant to do something greater, you know what I mean?And for a while I would just focus on music in a Marvin way.Do you know what I mean?But now I'm starting to realize it's not all about that even with music whatever it's about like I just have always felt like I meant to reach more people and somehow affect people, you know what I mean?So that might be part of this whole thing to is that I just some of that needs to be channeled toThat's what I'm feeling.I just need to you know, it's important to me.I think it was already this had already been on my mind a little bit, but that was just such an extreme thing.Yeah, I don't know.Well, just because like I was just thinking about how like when children are so helpless 1 Americans are so because I was also thinking about because I went off like I was just like I don't give a fuck what religion or culture you belong to but anything that allows that and that you don't actively try to stop you're just uncivilized animals.I'm sorry.I don't give a fuck what religion you belong to but then I was thinking I was like, yeah, but then that see then the problem is from the states when you say shit like that.That's so quickly.It's just such a jingoistic bullshit.These Packers don't know anything that's coming from someone who understands that most Muslims are totally normal people, you know.The one that made me think about like just seem that's because people don't know.I don't know that just made me think about like connecting to people and helping people just think whatever.I don't know what the specific thing is, but I think that that's music right?All these things are about thinking right.That's all it is.Really, it's not I want people to read my book of poetry and be like, oh I get the sky.It's not about I want them to have their own experience, you know, so I think that's just in general.It's just a general kind of just a way to get people to be critical thinkers, you know, so that's why I was like, well, you know what?It's fucking perfect on this nonprofit, you know, that would be a great way, like maybe part of the nonprofit would be like an Outreach, you know, I can go to schools and talk to kids are weeds and poems or have them right?I don't fucking know something.But those are all ways to help people think about things, you know, but also bettering myself, you know what I mean?Yeah, it's for I also want to make a living and I want to be comfortable and all that but there's no reason why you can't do those things and also do something beneficial.Right, right.Yeah.Yeah, and it's funny because that's all it it really has come back to like, how come he never thought to be a psychologist.They really make sense.Now.It's like wow my whole life really that's what it's about.You know.I mean, that's why I feel like I can do this job.Because if you're spending your whole fucking life reading Play-Doh and cameras poet it doesn't matter all these things are about who are we what the hell are we doing?Why do we do these things?What do we want all that stuff?So it makes total sense.Like, you know, I think it would be great to do like, you know, I don't want to do a PhD but it'll be great to do a masters.You know it be fascinating so but yeah that whole thing is part of it that you know, what poetry it's a very powerful thing.It's not just art, you know, like there's a way that you can really get people to think and you know, so yeah.So yeah, so yeah, I mean, it's all good.It's all just like yeah, it is not calibrating though right now.It's an extreme of I can't really shut that part of my brain off, you know what I mean?But it doesn't feel bad.Like I don't feel overwhelmed now, I just feel like all these things are just going to happen and do time, you know, likeYeah, yeah.No it doesn't it feels like it's all.And the thing is now all these things are connected whereas before what's the connection with ESL?You know, like, you know, it's some job this that now feels like this is all like one project, you know what I mean?So it doesn't feel otter contradictory or like I'm fucking tired after teaching prepositions all day and back kind of like I don't you know, yeah, it's crazy.Exactly.It's not exactly and now I can do it my way, you know because the thing I don't like about that and said it's still your working within a structure like yeah, I can kind of yeah my own syllabus whatever but the fact is a lot of those kids have to take that class.And so I don't blame them.You know what I mean?I'm not even I'm not there to know to you know, that's one to is you know, again is that you're working for somebody even if it's a great university job, you have that situation and that's okay.I'm open to doing that but like instead of this stuff that I'm doing being a side thing.That should be the side thing.It's all reversed.Like I have no problem teaching in a college.I'll teach like one course whatever to course is fine, but that's notThat's just for like pocket money and just to do it or whatever.So I think that's what feels so great.It's like now I don't feel like I'm beholding for some willy nilly though.They offered me a job.I guess I'll take it as a job.I don't know.You know, it's like no it's like, you know, yeah, it just feels like one project now.This is all about the same thing really?So yeah.No, I'm site, but we're more this means I have to do this home equity thing.It has to happen, you know, like for example my websites good but you know, it'd be great if I had you know, I don't know how to do like a really nice like sign up for newsletter.You know, like if I do it it's going to look a little I don't know, you know, it's just like the office you have the project you have to project something, you know people like the website and that's great.But you know, like I know that it could be better and you know, you have to pay people for that soOr even these courses there all these Great Courses at like brown extension.Just fucking pay for it and take a class.You know what I mean?At least I could start, you know, there's some really good psychology courses there.Oh, I see.Yeah.Well, that's more just you know, how I am.I just likeThat's important.And that wouldn't be that much money.We're talking like, you know, 800 bucks 700 bucks, whatever but no, of course if I had that absolutely I was like, oh my God, I can still register.It's right there I can taste it.But that's fine.It's spring.I don't give a shit.You know, that's fine.But yeah, so that's you know, at least if that's in play starting the spring semester.I can start taking, you know, like one class two classes, whatever just you know,I was going to talk about something else.It was on my mind earlier in the week.O you know what we've never talked about in here.I have one OCD thing that I do that I think it must mean something.You know, I don't know how to explain it.I have a habit and I think I've always I can't remember but I think I've always maybe have this I think it probably comes from being so musical but I have this OCD thing where I'll have to have some kind of Melody or just like a snippet of something.I'll kind of like sing it over and over again.Sometimes it's funny but I've noticed in the last few years that like weight was it that when I do that because a lot of times the random pad inside the same are the random words.It doesn't really mean anything.It's just a red nickel rhyming thing, but I pick the same and it's like a habit.It's become like an OCD have it I think and I don't know what theBut it's very very frequent that it's maybe it's not OCD.I don't know maybe a lot of people do this but something about it to me feels like it means something you know what I mean?What happens is it goes through phases like w Melody that will last for quite a while and then sometimes they'll be some other things but they'll be like one.Yeah.Yeah, but there is usually generally one base Melody.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.It's from it's like an Assyrian folk song anything it's hard to explain but it's used in a lot of like a Syrian dances or a Syrian.It's just like a fucking kind and I don't know if it if I started doing that or if one of my Assyrian friends, I don't know how it evolved butIt's like a couple of bars.Yeah.Yeah, it's like a loop.So that's one and then I think I've noticed about it is sometimes I do it in a manic way.It's almost like you know what it's like.Did you see Amadeus?Remember there was that really creepy seeing where it's kind of towards the end.Where is the lawn with the candles and he's like playing with theOkay, there's a scene where it's nighttime in his apartment and it's for the end.So he's already a little wacky and he just he just kind of starts dancing around his room and just you know, it's kind of like this weird moment of kind of like this.Yeah.It's not quite like that but there's something like that like it's just as Barry semi manic.I don't know what it what that is, but it has to be something.I know.I'm not the only one who does stuff like that.I just don't know what it is or what it means butI have no idea.It's like a nervous habit or it's aI don't think so.I mean, I think it's just something I do when it's like a filler or something or it's one a lot of times.It's what I'm happy, I think.Like sometimes I do it because the way Cecilia look at me is just so funny.It's just so you know, and she'll be meowing when I get home.She's so excited.I don't know if it's just like I'm an adverse event not manic.It's just like a little burst of energy.I guess.I don't know.I don't know what it is.I don't look my friends just to make them laugh.No, it's not always private know we'll be walking down the street and I'll I'll just start singing because they crack up and now they know it a lot of them know it so they you know what, I mean, so, I don't know if it's just like if it's just this like exuberant it's like something very deep that I feel that I can't put words to so because I'm musical that's the way you know, it's like if a math person just had a lot of numbers running through their heads or something.I don't know the thing.I can't remember though is how far back it goes.I don't that's the thing, but I don't even remember if you said like 6 years ago.I don't know.I don't know.Yeah, a lot of times.It's joyful.No, no, it's never when I'm sad.It's never when I'm angry or sad.It's generally.Yeah, it's generally some kind of semi funny.I guess.The only thing I'm saying though is I've noticed even when it is a good feeling.Let's say I'm just driving the cafe or walking to the cafe.I'll just be like I'll be repeating it.That's the only thing I don't you know what I mean?I'm going to become aware that I'm repeating it.So then it feels like kind of like wow.Why do I keep I don't know.I don't know if it's just totally nothing and it just is what I do when I'm having a nice walk to the cafe.Like I don't know.Maybe it's like aNo, no.No, it'sOh, okay.I mean it also could be a personality thing.Like we have like that's one of the reasons I love George.You just does things like someone will be walking by and he'll just say shit like we tend to do that, you know what I mean?And this might be part of it part of that.Like I just don't care.I mean, I'm not saying it loudly but you know kind of whispering because I just don't care.It's a beautiful day and I'm walking to the cafe.I don't give a fuk so they could be that but it's just yeah, I don't know.Just a repetition.Not even the song.It's just I mean, I don't think the song has it's justI just do these repetitive things.It's not always that song.It could be some other snippet or something that I got into the Habit where I'll just repeat repeat repeat repeat.It's just kind of like I just wonderKind of I think.I guess it's never been to the point where I'm like shit.I have to stop you know.Yeah.Yeah, I could I think I could yeah.Yeah because for example like when I do it to Celia, I immediately start laughing so I don't I don't even keep doing it because it's so fucking funny and she's you know, yeah, I'm looking at me like hey I keep doing it because she text me up.Yeah, I don't know overall.I think it's a good thing whatever it is.Yeah, it's very yeah, I think that's what it is.Yeah.Yeah, yeah because my friends we do especially with my Syrian friends.There's a lot of that and yeah, maybe because I do that till like if I'm walking down the street and I see someone we just say shit, you know, I'll just start saying shift to myself.I'll start insulting them like in like a Syrian but in ain my head or I mightYeah, I just met her at you know, but it's always playful.I'm not like really trying to insult them.Even if it's a woman with disgusting sandals or something.I'm not meaning any ill will it just makes me feel better?You know what I mean?Like, it's just a playful thing.I don't know.I can't explain it like George, you know, a lot of people that come to Christians George just he says chit in a Syrian to to them that are half insulting things, but he doesn't it's just funny.Basically what he's saying is I'm in this fucking place.I have to work 12 hours a day.You know, I'm exhausted.This is my way of making it lighthearted and who gives a shit so, you know, I'll make up words, you know, when someone's salad is ready or whatever just be like, you know.Kimiko I'll just say random shit.That's hilarious, you know.Some of the words he picks their playfully insulting.It's almost like saying what's a word, you know, it's not like hey bitch, you know, but like I don't know.Hey knucklehead.Hey dumbass, you know, yeah, they could be insulting but that's clearly not.You know, I do the same thing, you know, so yeah, and I think it's related.I think there's something related about that.Maybe yeah, maybe it's just a playful.Maybe it's just something we do because it makes us feel good feel better feel more lighthearted or something.Yeah.Yeah, yeah.Yeah well because that'sYeah know it is and yeah, there is with me too.I don't want to see that woman's discussing Footwear, but I think it's a healthier kind of aggression in the sense of like I'm not going to like actually be upset, but I do need to say I need to take a job or I need to make a joke.I need to you know.That's what it is, you know and the same with them is that they're not they're not going to sit there and let these like brown dumbasses with their dad's credit cards.You know what I mean?They need to be like, all right.Yeah, you know, it just helps, you know, I don't know.So yeah, maybe it is kind of like either working class or just feeling like, you know, we have we have to have our own way of maneuvering the world sometimes, you know, I don't know maybe it's an immigrant thing, you know, you're able to have that language.Gives you it's almost like a protective shield because you can just say shh, and people don't know what you're saying.And it makes you feel better.You know, it's almost like a coping thing.Yeah, but no it's a coping thing.I think.Yeah.It's a coping thing.Exactly exactly.exactlyYeah.One thing I always do is like there's a word for like Creek but it's such a funny way.It doesn't have the same feeling that we think of in English.So like I've been in shops and places where I feel like someone's just annoying me or they're just being something like I'll just be like, okay.Well, thank you, you know, I'll just say it.Oh, thank you because it's fucking hilarious and it helps me and immediately makes me laugh and it makes me feel better, you know, no harm no fowl.I don't have to actually dwell or think about you know, it doesn't become a real issue.You know what I mean?It just becomes a way to kind of I don't know.But yeah, I think those things are related.There's something related maybe about those things.exactlyYeah, yeah, exactly.Yeah, and yeah, it's funny because they all do it my other friend Jean, you know.Can uses the word dear you Syrian?Predire so I'll go get sushi or something and he's just hilarious.So, you know, the girl will come up and help you like thank you, you know, like, you know, he just doesn't give a shitt.So yeah, there's something about that.I mean, I don't know maybe I do it because they do it too.I don't know because I've noticed I do it more the older I've gotten in the more comfortable and The more I've gotten tight with them, you know, maybe I realized wow.Yeah that does feel good to do.You know, how do you open this and kind of sass, you know?Right, right.Well, it's also probably part of the actual freeing up like you know now I do, you know, if I'm talking to customer service and they're being assholes.I tell them you know, like I'm very you know, who I'm dealing with people in general is much more.You know, I don't keep it in, you know, but, you know, it may be part of the same thing.Alright 1256 Claire.See you.I'm tired.I was up late last night basking.I was awakened to the sound of street cleaning.I was a little bizarre, which is nice.They don't give you a warning and some places to come around with a loudspeaker.That means I had to move my car at 8.I should have gone to the sea to the CVS to pick up medicine.So my meds are so screwed up right now.The Prozac I started I up my dosage.So I've run out and I can't renew it until tomorrow.So I'm out of it.I just don't care.I don't feel like asking for extra to tide me over until tomorrow until I can get more or calling Micah.I still haven't gotten any new Klonopin and I refuse to call her.singer on Friday, so I figure I'll just get new prescriptions for theAll right, I guess I haven't had a whole lot to be really anxious over.I got this one kind of litigation case that's supposed to go on trial in January, which it looks like it looks likely but it's not I've got to tell the guy that's flying in from Europe that it's not going to happen.I'm putting a bad position because she wants to move the trial but she's supposed to propose the first draft of the pre-trial memorandum.Then I fill in my information and we go back and forth and Hammer out the memorandum for the judge.She's got to put in there all her Witnesses the facts on which she's relying her damages stuff.I don't have from her yet.The order for this thing came out months ago.And now she's claiming as requested on multiple occasions.I requested it yesterday and she's telling me that the clerk told her she doesn't need to do one what judge is going to go on trial without a memo.There may not be a conference, but you still need to do the memo.How do I get how do I go into court and say no don't continue this trial but by the way, I'm unprepared for trial because she won't do the memo.I'm in a catch-22.My guy is screwed because there's nothing I can do for him.We can't go to trial in January because I'm completely unprepared.I have no clue even what damages they're asking for because I don't have this memo in my mind.I've got certain strategic emotions.I'm going to play at the beginning of the trial which include Witnesses and testimony and all the stuff until she lays all that out what she has to do.This isn't like on TV where they all of a sudden come up with ever with everything is supposed to be out in the open.There are no surprises.I just trying to litigate by ambush.My client is caught in the middle of it and I'm caught in the middle of it and I don't really know what to do.What I what am I supposed to do ask for his plane ticket money as sanction, which they're not going to give me I'm losing a battle of their unwillingness unwillingness to litigate this case and I can't force them to the only thing I can think of is to do is ask them to dismiss the trial they send them not doing this memorandum.Well, it wins the battle not the war because there are sufficient remedies for this to offset her type of litigation.This is why Jesse hates divorce because they all litigate like this she stands there in open court and so she can do a trial on January 14th, and then all of a sudden she has another matter marked up and she's claiming the court never sent out a notice of the trial but she stood there and core in front of the judge and told the judge to his face.Yes.I can do a trial on that day.That's not going to be good enough.They're going to change the date because she's got something else.I'm in the position that I can't say judge.No, let's have the trial.We can't have the trial because I'm completely unprepared.Why am I am prepared because of her?That's why I'm going to try to ask her for her cause of action to be dismissed because she's not Prosecuting it the order has been out there.I've made multiple requests.She stands in open court and takes a trial date and then can't meet the trial date because she's got some other matter that she's now scheduled the judge said we need to get them the memo by December 1st, and she just plays dumb now she claims in an email that the clerk told her.She doesn't need to do a pre-trial memo.I think the clerk may have said there's no pre-trial conference, but I refuse to go to trial without a pre-trial memo.That's totally ambitious me, you know.Now I've got to go in and first of all, she's got to serve this motion.I may just go ahead and file my motion to dismiss.I've got to figure out what basis if there's any case law or anyting I'm thinking the way to beat this woman is to just start dragging her into court and on stuff make her life difficult, even if it it makes mine.I've got to know email my clients and tell them once again, we've been duped not duped but things are out of our control you switching and coming home for Thanksgiving instead of that and coming home for a trial in January.That's now not going to happen.At least you get to see your family.I could say just fire me that would make it easy.Yeah, totally.I'm anxious about it, but it's just happened.So many times.I don't know why I get anxious about the real estate stuff, but and I'm not as anxious as I would be about this stuff.I guess I've been anxious over it for so long that I finally just gotten used to it.I don't know.I've just got anxiety about the helplessness I guess but it's not like concern I'd have about getting these payoffs and all these little things involved in closings.I don't know.It just doesn't make sense to me that this other stuff gets me so worked up by the way.Did you get my text?Yesterday, I was just following up on the IRS letter.That's good, I guess.My lawyer said the 13th, but I think as long as we're getting them stuff.Some of it can be a little delayed.So Friday would be fine.Yeah.When is the 13th what's today the 11th?Yeah, Friday would be fine.You can't say that.I'm in the same.Obviously.I'm not as bad as the last letter that obviously had me in a really bad state.I would focus on how I still have difficulties with work in Newark.Whatever.Sounds good.It's okay.First of all, they wanted the business statements updated.And of course, I've made all this money in the last month or so, but I already spent it that one out the door as soon as that came in.I could see the money go in and I could see the money fly out.The thing is my bank statements don't have the checks copies of the checks or the actual.Right, so they don't know who the payee is our Iran a payee report.I think they're probably going to raise our monthly amount, but they're going to cut it back from a 60-month to a 24 month which is a huge chunk of money.Yeah, they're shortening it no matter what I think they've already committed to shortening it but we proposed to 60 months plan.So, I don't know we're really just not pulling in a lot of money.At least that's what it was.Looks like it's the truth.I can't use my heat.It's a good thing.It's warm out.There's a hole in my linwood's chimney.Did they put a temporary patch on but the chimney guy needs to come out and fix it.They don't want to turn the furnace on until he comes out to fix it, which may not be until later today or tomorrow.It was like 71 degrees in my apartment this morning.So I just wear my sweatshirt.I kind of just wanted to go back to bed but after drinking the coffee, I have one title to do.I think I might go into the office and do that.I should go into the office and be productive check mail and see if that motion came to continue the trial.I guess part of it is I feel like I should be fighting but I really don't know what to fight how to fight or I really don't know what I should be doing.Yeah, part of it is knowing when to battle even though you're going to lose the battle and I just give up I'm like pee on it.They're going to move the trial.Oh well.Yeah, another system.I can't win can't beat.Yeah.One of the things I was worried about with my closings from Friday was the wires not getting there until today.I didn't want to bring that up Friday to the attorney.So my client told me they already knew you mentioned the wire had come in and I was like, I'll check with my client.She was like, oh, yeah, they're not going to be able to send a wire until Tuesday because they've got to wait for some security used to clear I think is the problem is coming from her financial.She didn't expect to pay $5,000 to saw her house Chase they suck.I don't know just as supposed to be working with them, and I just don't want to talk about it.So I just don't bring it up.Over the weekend.I was kind of like, oh, I've got to deal with that.I'm going to the game and I'm going to have to deal with this wire issue.It feels like I'm going to have to play the flexion to some degree.They did contact me at all yesterday.So they must have finally told them or they went to the listing agent or listing agent or they found out some other way that they weren't getting them the wire.I can't see them not getting the wire not knowing I'm not calling either or emailing that kind of stuff that kind of the stuff is the stuff.I'm worried about.I'm worried about getting an email from somebody where I'm going to respond.Okay, let me check into it and not do anything.Yeah, I think there's some truth to that.I'm concerned about how it's going to reflect on me.No.I could have told them Friday as I'm telling them they can't they can't have the keys The Leverage would have been for them.Oh, you're going to be late an extra day on The Wire really two days and now you're telling me you're not going to let my client in there.I just avoided at all because I didn't bring it up that was tactical on my part.No, I asked emitted the money for them.I was pretty close and I gave them the heads up once I saw their loan balance was what their loan balance was how they could not take their loan balance and add the commission and realize that that was over over the shell price.I don't know.I know not everybody is good with numbers.But before they sold the place I went through and told them what the fees and expenses are going to be there were supposed to pick the sale price based on not having to bring money at closing butI mean, it's 250,000 251,000 actually, which is pretty cheap for anything in that area.It's like a one-bedroom.It's Garden level.It's over a pond right by the football field.At the pool it runs right alongside the park so you're right there.You got the bus stops Whole Foods Trader Joe's CVS.Organic sushi place liquor store.It's pretty cool.It would be a good spot for me.I'll have to think about it.Yeah, that's a big one and you're myself up to like okay.This is what you're going to do and then I don't do it or I feel like I'm not going to do it.I took my blood pressure down and it was high.I'm off the blood pressure medication.I don't want to go back on it.But I may have to it sucks.I'm tired of all the pills.I beat myself up to get this Rush title done down while Ian is bothering me.I'm working away on at all morning.And I forgot to send it.They sent me an e-mail yesterday morning house this coming.I was like, oh I finished it last week and forgot to send it to you while I've got to get an email to them.They owe me over 3,000 now and I don't know what I don't know what's closed and what hasn't, you know, maybe I could do that today.What I've got to do is everything for me comes up by invoice number, but they've got everything by property address.SoThey're going to know whether it's closed or Not by property address not the invoice.I've got to go through and make a list for them that matches up the invoice number with the property address.I have no way of generating that other than manually and there are a lot of them out there.I think I'm just going to do an end-of-the-year open invoice if I'm not going to get the money until next year then taxes go up.Something's rattling your sprinkler.It's very frustrating because I kind of get like I have all these closings lined up every time the money comes in.I don't know where it all goes.It's gone.I'm trying to get to them to the point where I have expenses put away.So when I have a bad month or two, I can survive that but it's like I can't get to the point.I could not buy tickets and stuff like that.But what's that going to do for my depression?It's a catch-22.If I didn't if I don't go to the games, I'll be depressed and spending the money on the games makes me depressed.Yeah, but still the end of EX coming up so much of it is taxes.Do you pay your estimated taxes like a good boy?That's what I'm thinking about.Next is January every month starts the state and every 3 months.There's the estimated.That's the other thing.I'm trying to have money set aside for estimated taxes.Every time I try to put money into my savings account or whatever.I've got to pull it out 2 weeks later or something.At least I'm getting caught up big-time on my rent.I was really behind.I think I'm almost caught up.I think I'm still a couple of months behind but like just November and December, I think maybe I don't know.I got caught up on my student loans.Which I was in serious default.I'm getting caught up on the website.I was way behind on that.I'm still some I'm still somewhat behind on it.But there's always like I forgotten about $300 to service I didn't pay for but when I close the lawn normally I just cut the check right then for the survey.Yeah plot plan.It's like with these guys should be cutting me for the title.As soon as they finish the closing a check for Cameron.I try and do the same thing, but I forget which is what they do when cleared the only reason I remember it is because a check I'd written in November just cleared unlike all Buck.I forgot to pay those two.There's just always something.I'm going out for my grandmother's 90th birthday party.I'm taking you in I think my mom is going to pay for his ticket.I've got to buy the tickets.They just came down $4.I'm checking them on kayak and Ice website.I know as soon as I buy them now, they're going to drop it should be cheaper than $327.My mom paid like 280 or something like that.It's cheaper at 280.But if she's going to pay for one of them at 3:20, the question is how long I go out for I fly out on Friday.Hopefully if they're in the Super Bowl, that's the same day as her birthday party.I'll come back on Monday or Tuesday.If I come back on Monday.We're literally out there for just two days, but it's not like I'm going to be up to take him and doing a whole bunch of stuff.I don't know if I'm going to have to rent a car or not.That's what I said because I'm not that I should be concerned about how much school he misses.I don't think it's going to affect him.He's a smart kid.You can catch up.Keep him out of trouble.I have a feeling he gets in more trouble there.It seems like Lucille is gradually more and more getting used to me.I can't leave every time I say I'll write Lucille.I'm going to go no, no, no, no.No, it's not good.Yeah, I feel guilty though.Usually I'll leave because I'm just bored out of my mind or just I don't know we were at Cub Scouts and I had a little sing along just in case you came they were in town Lucille was just holding on to my leg.She was having fun titling behind my leg.Sometimes you would just come up and what she usually does to Jess.She's scared.Sobut the good thing is you want.To change diaper no mama.Okay and wanted to sleep over Friday.I was just exhausted.I can't remember why I was really against in was upset and just said I'm putting her in the middle of it.I need to come to a set schedule.I was like you asked me hours ago.You tell him then that I can't do it.I was like you can come over Saturday Saturday then buddy what she did.Yeah, we went to a friend's house for deep fried turkey.He has a little boy and they got to watch TV the Disney Channel.He doesn't have cable.He gets to see the TV shows his friends talk about that.He never gets to see because he sees you seems to know these shows.I don't know where he would have seen them.Then the next morning.He spent the whole morning into the afternoon playing with the girl downstairs, which is good that he can come over and has friends there.It would drive me crazy if we were just cooped up in the apartment when we had buddy.We used to always go to parks and seem to be walking around a lot more.Yeah, I think he just gets bored quickly.So it's like the idea that he wants to go is still on his mind.But once he gets there, he still likes Wings.He still wants to be pushed like dude.Come on while we were down in Louisiana.My buddies kid had a bat and they had a bunch of tennis balls.I was throwing them some soft pitches and he was taking some swings.I was thinking that might be a good thing for us to do get him a bath and a bunch of tennis balls and go to the park.I try and do that.It's like you want to go throw frisbee.Do you want to kick a soccer ball?with your daughtersI love those and used to be afraid to go on those by himself, but he loved it.I would get sick inside of those things.I don't know if it was the air or what but I'd come out and I'd be so nauseous.He was like, let's do it again.Let's do it again.They have those at the fair, which is down in Louisiana.He just starts going on them.That was a slide, but they have the big blow up.He just loves that stuff.That's fine.If you need to take the time to write a letter, I feel bad that I'm giving you homework.It sounds odd, but I'm kind of feeling over therapist.I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm actually not sure.I don't know.I'm finding myself with a I'm finding myself really emotionally exhausted.Well sometimes but sometimes Cell Therapy helps and I don't know like I don't know like if I don't want to like talk about dealing with some things or if I want to meet less frequently for a while or what?With the you know, of course always are I just want to avoid dealing with myself?Which is always an option.I don't know like I was thinking about this a little bit like you know, so and then I use the sort of stair like no, I think like I like meeting frequently, but right now I don't know and it's not like meeting frequently for some of that but I don't know I guess because I think what I want is some relief from I just don't want to have to deal with it or think about like difficult stuff like like one of the things I hated about out was feeling like I don't want to do this again.Like I don't know I felt like I've already talked about that a lot and it's really hard and I don't want to like go back to square one of that, but then I saw her again andI think I was more circumstantial.This was when I was at the bus stop.Yeah.and then like last week, I was at a coffee shop with a friend and right outside the window A car pulled up and she got out and started you no fussing with her stuff and got out and left or I don't know but I was facing directly out to the window and what sort ofgive that is I mostly was just like I don't really feel stressed about like I don't think I'm going to feel stressed unless she walks in to this where I am like the shop that I'm in but like seeing her doing whatever wasn't feeling stressful, which was good because I just I guess seeing her just brought back so many negative like just really bad and made it like doing and justI don't think I don't to be like I just don't know.I don't want to do it like I do but I don't know if that makes sense because I didn't feel any like anything good about not being upset or scared her her of her or having like longing for her and then the situation with the bus.I felt like I don't know like I rebooted almost but that's what it felt like that like on the moment.I just mostly just that once I got home and the next day a few days.I just got in the game.Oh God, like do I have to do this all over again if that makes sense?and then I'm always I'm frequently reluctant to say this about myself that I have PTSD and extremely I find it extremely difficult to say that I was in an abusive relationship in which I can kind of say thatUnlike with the Boston bombings.I'm just all of that and my parents.I don't know the kind of just don't I don't know.I don't.Yeah, I'm just having this like but I don't like I guess it's not like when I went okay, but I think we should talk about this even though I don't want to.It's more like I just don't want to.But I don't want to stop meeting entirely because I'm confident about it.And yeah, like there's that therapy is kind of hard.I think with the other thing with that one of the things that I find helpful sort of comforting or something like that.Like when I'm feeling is I make myself do routines of like, okay, you have to get up by this time.You have to be out the door.You have to buy your coffee.You think I'm like when you get home you have to do like these things and I'm doing that but it's still like I guess it's not that it's not helpful because it is but it's not being as I guessed helpful as it usually feel like I feel like I'm still missing things and dropping things and not remembering like yesterday at work.I just had I was having one of those work days.It was super disrupted which was like I was so tired when I got in at 9:30 someone came up my co-workers and was like, there's nobody at the reference desk and someone needs help with the microphone.I'm just like, okay, I guess I'll help them and I asked them to like find a reference Librarian from the office and have them come.becauseafter they did that and then like I was up and down checking like something else for the so like I didn't really sit at my desk for my 15 minutes ish, which I just felt like I couldn't carry a thought is that make sense?Like I thought I couldn't sit at my desk long enough to sort of like I guess start like a pot and then finish it and then like, I don't know like I just I'm so tired.I'm like, I don't know part of it.I'm sleeping.Well, but also I just feel so like I really feel ambushed and overwhelmed.And I really don't like I've been partially part of that one of the things that was part of it was I was just like I can't go through this like I just felt like I don't like I kind of was coping with it.But I do I really feel like I was I was kind of like I'm making a series of fly-by-night decisions that aren't exactly decisions more like reaction and like I don't know it's just so I'm feeling so out of control and not able to like take care of me and just like yeah like it's hard.Like does it get better?I was like today like take care of me.I thought I was having a hard time telling anyone else.What was the problem and then also which always stresses me out?Like I ran out of the cat food the one my cat likes cats like and they both are meowing cats.So I was just about that.I'm like, I'm sorry you're yelling, but I can't do anything about this right now.I don't know just like all of that together.Just I guess it does like it does make me feel crazy in a way like like sometimes I'm flatlining and also like well, you know, maybe it's comic like a you're experiencing for a longer time side effects or whatever, but I don't know I feel so frustrated in the end that like reading fiction and watching like TV or movies, which I do a lot.I don't know.I really don't want to or can't watch anything but like is difficult I guess.my roommates obsessed with Breaking Bad, which I don't watch and usually if she's watching it like sometimes I'll sit myself next to her and like or do whatever but right now I'm like I can't be in the room if that's onyes way too disturbing and like I always find it disturbing but right now I'm just like I can't just teed off or for me to be in the other room.which I actually feel bad about because through feeling bad like she feels bad that I am the I'm exiling myself to the bedroom and I feel bad that she feels bad about that andYeah, and she look and just and says I'm being ridiculous about not wanting to watch it or not.If I'm watching TV and she's able to concentrate on anything at all.And I can't on the TV and almost always distracts me except for sports because there's like no.But I'm also super stressed and I don't know who wants to help me with work stuff.I also find it super stressful.I also find me super stressful and I don't know like part of me is like yes.I do want to like if you really can't get any also.That probably is like and what would they do?Like what would happen next and also like and then really occupy here like maintaining my own mental health.So if I were to choose I would choose working and keeping my me saying rather than dealing with sexual discrimination and I'm sitting in that group office.I think you almost fall on everyone.It's really like I feel like I feel like I can't relax and concentrate relax or concentrate or I don't know like it's different than being in like a cute Farm behind like there's a penis or whatever.Because like people are just students there just kind of like wandering in and out all the time and I can't say no like because we're an open service area.We're supposed to help anyone that come anybody that comes up but I likethe other like other open service areas like the library opens their own reference desk for like an hour or two and they go and sit in their offices and it's so cute.It's like whatever the 6th off for like in the back and the different people like on duty and whatever someoneand say someone comes up person for like that anyone has to deal with it and I tried to and have not been successful and also the process in doing that is just so exhausting like and I guess you saywhat you do?What do you want me to do about that?I have to work your two and a I don't care and be I think it's a crappy setup and it should be reconsidered reconsidered.It's like somebody being an open kitchen at work.Everyone can stare at you cooking and you can make mistakes and someone is staring at you.Actually, it's more like the stuff that I think I should work on.But I don't feel any more.like I don't think thatI do not feel like you have the should be it's totallySure, I guess as a feeling sometimes I some of this happened yesterday.To that.It feels like I'm kind of jumping into the sort of feelings or associations to what you're talking about kind of like both feet.Like yesterday I about had, you know something that you know was disturbing or that you weren't really upset about having had gone last week or was really shaken up by it.But I guess I had the impression that you know, well, it's already going to be helpful to like mother and to your family.Maybe you probably already did but to kind of be talking about that can also be pretty overwhelming.I mean, it feels like something you sort of lose control over a bit.Like I've got to see what I'm going to say about it.Yeah, which is what I want.But then sometimes also I'm like I would just like I don't know but it's like sometimes I feel like okay.I thought I was dealing with this thing and then it's like oh, but actually it's like this thing, you know, which is good to I'm kind of like I do want to know that I just maybe don't want to know about right now.Or you don't want to know what to I guess sometimes I don't know what to do with it.It's just it's that like, okay, so I think about all these things, but I'm too tired to it's too much to think about like to continue pressing after.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, and I think also.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, it does and that sort of like I mean conflicts or whatever in the moment is freaking really hard like I do anything talking about.My mom is super hard in the moment because part of because like I will I know what it is, like it's called.It's like my brothers psychiatrist saying like the reason you're bipolar is because you're mixed race.and then sort of a few of like that was something that both my brother and I have heard like as well, you know, like I know field marriages but what about the children we get so mixed up and Confused like weyeah, so it's like I mean, we both say that to like me or him or my parents which we both have.It's like it's incredibly it's incredibly weird.And so like my first reaction is generally like fuck you.I'm fine.Like actually I'm alsoWhat are you talkin about?And so then it becomes difficult to be like well actually mistakes are made but not because my parents are different races, but for other reasons and so sometimes it feels really hard to kind of like be like, nope.We're not we're like this is not actually a discussion about whether or not my parents made a mistake and having children.But like I guess like it's hard to that's my knee-jerk reaction is to sort of defend the concept of having mixed race kids.I'm not like I have emotional problems not because of like racial and that's also one of those things where I feel like people like people like to use the existence of interracial families and mixed race people has like a metaphor.I was like look racism isn't over because of law or like I am the embodiment of the end of racism and racial unity and that's a lot for a person and I also don't mix combination.And so I don't know I feel like I've had a lot of conversations and which I thought because I felt like oh we're talking about me, but we're not actually we were talking about like like they're trashing a mixed-race person the symbolic person and so it's like I have this like, you know, instead of like things that getting out of that can be hard but I'm unwittingly trampling all this stuff.Yeah, I mean even if that is true, I just don't I don't know.I don't think about that a lot probably because Messi incredibly high standard of not a good job, okay?Or like over being because over being can like yeah, okay high standards, but I mean it's more than what I'm used to and I'm like used to getting I think like it doesn't always register.Yeah coming from them.You have said things that I disagreed with.yeah, the other thing is that I've been thinking about is I when we talked at one point about doing like I was surprised as to how strong a reaction I had the idea of not being able to see you likeYeah, it was two one was lie down into lying down and not being able to see you sort of come by and I just like which it's not the money has been an issue for me before and like I've had male gynecologist and was like don't care, you know, like the gender of like whoever is treating me doesn't has never been an issue for me and suddenly I'll say this actually feels like a huge thing.I got a massage recently and a friend of mine was like, oh my male partner does massage and he might or barter and I thought I'm not sure if I can let a guy massage me right now.Like I have in the past like a lot not a lot but like it's not been something that I've cared about and I just had this like very strong sort of like nope, like nope.Nope.Nope.Nope, and then had this week.Why is this why is it so troubling to be right now?Like I guess and it's still kind of percolating or something.things I guess like you'reIs like the environment in some way?I guess it's the fear of not being able to tell but it might happen.And then not being able to do anything about it.But if after the first beer it is not being able to see I'm not it's not something that's been like I don't know.I don't like what I don't like living like you're hanging but I mean that's like but just to me it's sort of like but I I know who this person is and yet I feel I still feel scared about it and it feels like intense intensity.Like I guess I feel like I'm like, I'm even an irrational fear of like that's not actually going to happen.You are not going to leave out like an action move but like it's just like a rational crazy feeling like in my head.Feel like I guess it's really like not getting a warning not being able to read somebody else's body language or is it there is something I guess not like not getting a warning.And all of a sudden just being with a monster.I think it's kind of it's a a lot of how I feel.I just be sort of what happened here.And I also started realize this but I was thinking recently how I'm doing like public speaking or meeting.I spend a lot of time looking at people's body language and like trying to I guess trying to read where like reading is going where people are going like I can really I can get really caught up in like am I sitting pissed off am I sitting whatever?Okay.I think I want to talk about it more next week.Except I may be really exhausted on Monday.I'm going to be out of town all weekend.Stick with Tuesday and talk about it.I want to talk to you on Tuesday and go from there.XVIMonday is the 15th.Didn't set my alarm and it didn't go off.So zorg woke me up at 12:35 saying don't you have an appointment with Chad today?So I may be still a little bit.Pink's yeah, I think I'm awake.I was mostly worried about that.I was going to stumble out into the street and once I got outside, I was like, okay Tanya you really have to pay attention.So I went out for drinks after church last night was sort of not the normal crowd of parishioners that I usually go to but the crowd of the pig musicians in one of the priests and some other people.I feel like I've been doing some more socializing recently and good but man, it just makes me just not during it actually but afterwards I can't stop picking things apart that I said and things that I said wrong and reasons for them to hate me and call that so if you'll start of paradoxical that I have had a nice evening out with some friends it is something that makes me feel sort of bruised and anxious and I don't know maybe particularly vulnerable but I don't know that's the way I am.So it isIt's funny.I sort of was worried about my drinking and about that.I was drinking a lot more James and I just haven't really bought any beer in the last month like just haven't done it and I just don't really notice.So that makes me happy.I mean not quite as happy as I could because I would like to be drinking beer, but what I noticed I think that but most of the time I don't really notice I had some nice beer last night though.I'm doing good.Yeah, it was good.I felt like this morning at least I keep getting upset with James and I don't know whether it's that he's doing things differently that I'm more sensitive to the things that he says than usual or that I'm different.Yeah, like we're driving into therapy and the traffic is frustrating.So he sort of his snippy with me and it is like the most predictable occurrence in the world.It's not really okay, but I also told him that it's not really okay and it keeps happening and I don't want something I'm sort of willing to put up with I don't like this but it's not like that big of a deal and I know that I know what's going on and we sort of talked about that and went like, okay, that's fine.And you know, it just gets under my skin.Actually that pretty much just gets under my skin every time I try for it not to and I tried different ways of handling it but it just keeps getting under my skin.But on the way back I mentioned I haven't forgot 10 wanting to get a tent andyeah a tent and his immediate and the only response was yeah, we really can't afford that right now and I was like, I really know we know we can't afford it.I really know I just feel like I'm trying to tell you that I'm lonely and I want compact companionship and I feel like I'm being rebuked for wanting these things at all.And that's not really responsible a reasonable response on my part.It's sort of a jump.I feel like to ask him to see this code and what I said on the other hand, I don't think it's a jump for me to want his knee-jerk response to me say that I want something to be like we can't afford that.Yes, yeah.I think that's probably at that it's sort of easier to refer in Broad Strokes to this Dynamic and I feel like I've talked about before and it's also so naked.I feel like I'm under the impression that I've talked about it to you before but maybe not.Oh, I'm likeJames is frustrated in part and part James is frustrated with driving and we try to make a left turn off comment on to the church and we could only see the right hand side.I said this is your turn and he said is it I don't think is that what the sign says?I don't think it's my turn and I was like no, I guess that's not what the sign says, but it was actually the turn before a different Road on both sides of the street.So we missed it and you had to make a U-turn and he was so frustrated and I could sort of feel him wanting to make it my fault, but it was clearly.I was the one who said this is your turn because I remembered it.So there was that and then he didn't actually try to make it my fault, but you could sort ofI could feel it.Because I also have a problem where if he expresses frustration, I take it as being about me.Even if he's not actually making it about me.Yeah, but I feel like I actually think it that bad but I think my expectation was that if I described it that it will be sort of freshly painful and will be like reliving it and be freshly painful.Whereas if I just sort of allude to it or talk about the dynamic then that is something I have more control over.Yeah, I was feeling like a big bruise today and I don't really know why.Yeah, I'm not sure why.Pretty tough.Actually, you know I'm in.Oh.Sounds really fun.It's sort of like after I came home and it started getting tough.Yeah, I also did self-injury today.It's like a superpower.I love it.No, that's okay.There's something else too.Yeah.Maybe I'm a little more comfortable being the one doing the interpreting.Maybe I just want to feel like I think it's one of the reasons I take all of this sort of therapy.It's kind of like stuff.I'm quite familiar.It makes sense to me.But it's comfortable.I also don't.I'm sorry, it's just it also doesn't it continues to surprise me that I am interpretable that in that way.It shouldn't but it does.About framing it as getting under my skin.Ya know it's always the trouble of the part of me that really wants people to know and part of me that really doesn't.sono, it's okay.I don't know if you'll send me like I never stop thinking that I should be able to control it.But like there's not a way that I could phrase it that works.That would make me feel like it was incumbent on me to keep it.So to say like yeah, sometimes things are just out there is to say like I've really failed in some way.I'm sorry.I don't know.That's one of those things that yeah, I know.That's that that's not the way that you feel and it's not the way that everybody feels and maybe I do still feel that pretty much everybody that I need thinks.I should keep myself under control.I don't know.It's sort of hard hard to tell.I was waiting for a train yesterday and somebody was yelling cunt and it sort of surprised me like like how afraid that makes me feel.It's like seriously come on, but still sort of freak out.Yeah.Sort of a way of thinking about the it had not occurred to me.I mean because like I want to be connected to people but it's hard for me to exceptionally being connected to people means that the things they do want matter to me and I won't just be able to absorb that.Yeah.You know, I can't far to figure out why I would think that people knowing that I cut myself is why I would think that think of that is shameful thing or really like that.It bothers me when James is snippy with me, but that is something that I'm ashamed of.I don't know, you know afraid and also ashamedYeah.It feels sort of like so I write this blog, you know, like once every two or three months.I'll write something and it's a public blog and I will post a link to on Facebook and it never fails to sort of surprise and terrify me when people read it.Like what is wrong with me?I don't know.I wonder why I'm I'm not sure about this, but I wonder whether I'm ashamed of not being able to keep things under control or ashamed that I want to tell people about these things.I don't think I want people to know.I don't know.Yes.Yeah, I think it feels like I just shouldn't we live these things from people relieve these things from people?Like I shouldn't need James to be nice to me as much as I do.So yeah, I get that.I can.Yeah, yeah.Sorry, I've been sort of.Getting upset and I don't know what I'm about like being here talking to you.And soI don't really know what to say about that, but it happens.Sorry.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, it's scary for me to think about how much I need to be here how much it helps.I know.Yeah, I just feel sort of unbearable to say it.Yeah.Yeah, I feel like one of the things that is very scary for me about this relationship as well.Like the things that I do to start of State control of the situation.Don't really work very well.Which I know is the point.It also feels like there's a relationship.There's probably a relationship between the things that I do to stay in control the situation not working and how much I need to be here and that's a little scary.Yeah, it sort of feels like a connection.That's so obvious that why would he pick at it to me?I guess not.How are you?You don't take spring break.Are you now?It's spring break this week.Everything looks dead.Hahaha.It doesn't.Yeah.No, I'm just saying good.Not that it feels like spring out today.It feels dull because no one's around and yeah, and I think it would be pretty unhappy if I wasn't in college life if I wasn't part of something big with a lot of people walking, hahaha.I kind of had a I guess lately someone interesting experience yesterday.I had to go with David to his chairs for dinner the department head and it was dreading the whole time.Like I don't want to do it.I don't want to do it because usually I mean I always try but I think I spoke about this before when I've been to his professors or friends places.I've always felt awkward.I feel like I've internalized what I felt with them like on Saturday night.His friends came over there a couple they teach with David in the same place and they have to kiss and I felt so awkward the whole time they made me feel so uncomfortable when they were doing anything, but just like it felt.I mean, they're both Economist so they were mostly talking aboutIs there kids let them they were mostly talking about economics and I don't know what to say and you know, they tried to ask me question.What are you doing?How are you doing?It feels so weird.Hahaha, but yesterday after her place the chairs place I was driving it.But as soon as I walked into her house, she said I've been renting this place for a long time and you know, it was a single mom so immediately I felt like I can be myself.And yeah, I was I enjoyed I talked a lot.I was very unselfconscious and like when she asked me what I was doing and David always tells me I never answer that question.I'm very cryptic Word answers that don't inspire people to ask anymore.But I as soon as she asked me if I gave her every new thing that could be someone would say what I was doing where I was studying.I had no shame because usually I would be very ashamed like them Professor me student.Hahaha, but I wasn't so I told her and I realised because like all his friend are so full of themselves.They're so sure there's no certain and I don't feel comfortable at all with them like they come.Family background so, you know there's a class difference what I feel and then you know a gender difference for house.They just look very sure of themselves and very they have it all together and I don't see any sign of distress.You can't when you meet somebody the first time still I mean last night I thought you can perhaps you know, so I thought that was interesting and then David and I were talking about marriage last night about how I don't want to get married and I I don't know we talked about a relationship but I've been I've not been feeling like talking to him at all or like I didn't want to tell him all those things as directly as I did last night just because it seems like you know couldn't do it, but I know basically like we were saying that so he was like, why don't you want to get married and I was like, no.He said something like to me marriage just means that it's the commitment you're saying to someone that you want to be with them for the rest of your life.So I was like, yeah, that sounds pretty nice, but I still don't feel like seeing that to you.You just don't Inspire that kind of passion, you know, like I feel like that statement should be full of, you know, strong emotion and you just don't Inspire strong emotion, you know, you're prettyCall Kirsten and I haven't shared my emotional side with you or when I have Shady about the responses like you no crickets or something, you know, it's hard for that to say that feel that you know, not that I haven't felt that with other people.I have you no other things have happened that made us not be together for the rest of our lives.But I was saying, you know, I mean, it's not I don't think that we shouldn't be together.Although in the back of my head.I was like, oh that's pretty true.But but like, you know trying to be with him has required me to change a lot, you know, like, you know, like when you said that I speak here is basically, you know, it's either David things this way so I should think this way or David thinks this way.So I want to do the opposite so he's always a center and I'm always doing everything with respect to him most of the time right?I mean, that's an unusually preoccupied.So to be with you I figured that the only thing I could do is to be preoccupied myself all the time and we can have life and we can share those things.We can cook together.We can play Angry Birds, you know, hahaha and and that that's what I said as I mean not not likePassionate or not really emotional or not adventurous or not explain the world together and he didn't say much.He wasn't like well he did say when I said, you know, you're thinking has become like the rules.So I was like that sounds bad, but he wasn't like therefore we should break up or therefore block, you know, it wasn't likelike, you know, like I was telling him that I always think you know, what would you think in this area?Yeah, so he was like, that's bad.Nothing, I think on later.He said like you disappoint me too.And I was like, oh, but at first he was like, yeah, I know it's General disappointment satisfaction when the other person is he was like you never say hi to my parents when they come on Skype.So I was like, well blah blah blah blah blah.I try really hard to be to connect with you your mom and she and I we just don't connect and you know, she's like you she's not all emotional.I mean, she's so unemotional to the extent that won her 98 year old mother passed away.She the David's mom was in India and when David's mom's mom was in a different place in the country and we were there.So how did like talk to her on the phone for like an hour to convince her to come to for her mom's funeral and she then came and her brother had organized issue.No, thanks for that their mom and you know, he was crying.He was like this very very tough guy and see how to make a speech or something.So she was just very very awkward.She just said I'm here.It's nice to be here.Thank you.I understand.She had a difficult time when he was younger.She did she's with her mom, but you don't feel anything really like you really can't think back on any not any instance of how your mom said you loved or aren't you sad?You know, how long after me a lot like you and it just made its the cultural or whatever, but I know women how can you be like that?Maybe I shouldn't say that just as you know, where is saddened by your mother's passing, you know, but anyway, we try to we just don't connect.I mean she really she reads a lot.And all but then you know that statement of her she made years ago writing is a luxury when I was trying to be become a writer that really hurt me and I think I'm holding on to that and not forgiving her for that.Sosoyeah.Yeah, it's like that.That's how it is.I mean, that's what I mean about not connecting emotionally.It seems no motion can be significant enough to make a difference, you know.Oh, yeah, there's several reasons.I mean I'm using him to pay my mom's rent.The other concern is what do I do if I want to go to India and I'm realizing that I could possibly find a cheaper place in those are I mean, I'm sure there are other spaces like probably I don't like to share a place with a lot of people but I don't know I'm just gotten very comfortable to use that excuse has a nice place and and we like each other we have affection.I mean in a way I'm thinking yeah, so actually he brush it aside.Maybe that's a good thing.Maybe it shows what it shows what his priorities are and I need those priority should be my priorities.I know, you know like moving on with work, you know.Run am I mean like him brushing because you said that we had a big conversation and what happened as a result, right?Yeah, that's what I'm saying.Like he doesn't do anything if you know the conversation is over in.Let's move on with your date.That's what I think.So maybe I should do that too is what I'm saying, like a cat like his priorities become my priorities are not wearing too much and how to spell and you know.Yeah, well, he said he's not that Keen on marriage.It's just for his parents sake.Now I'm so confused because of this.I feel I don't have the guts to change my life situation.And as a result, I'm stepping someone else's priorities with my own.I'm forgetting who I am and what I want but since I have such a strong independent streak, I think I have a strong.I mean I'm about and then I don't find a way to connect emotionally with the most important supposedly most important people in my life.So look for other people or other places and don't find them and then so I continue being miserable.I don't know sad.I mean most people in Academia, they don't have time for emotions, right?I mean, they're busy right there very busy.Yeah.That's true.That is true.So, how are the emotional?I'm a loss ofNo, I'm not trying to I mean, I'm sure it's not be but here I'm not trying to defend them are like, you know eulogized I'm a glorified I'm just saying that and I'm kind of reasoning with myself like saying why you making such a big deal with emotions, you know, most people don't have time for emotions are you know who you really are, you know, so then but then you know, it's the thing that some professions are Maybe I'm Wrong.Yeah, you're right.My something is wrong.I don't know it just feels like as if David does it I'm thinking so it must be like this for a lot of his friends in for the larger community that they just have to work all the time because they have to get 10-year.They have to get published in.So they're mostly just at the computer working and not yeah, but I mean the guy who the friend friends who come on Saturday this week day of the week off and they're skiing somewhere and I'm not saying that emotion, you know, but it is, you know vacation.But David has to be part of a whole bunch of initiative and things to get meaning out of like and I'm trying to do that right now.I'm not saying it's bad.It's probably good for me, but it doesn't mean that I get to you know, it's not all that.I am you know that I'm like, I don't know what I'm trying so hard to change so I may know what I want.It's just that I'm trying to change and so on the process I'm getting confused maybe purposely soYeah.To be with David to make it work because he keeps saying he loves me and I'm like, I don't know if anyone else could love me, you know, so.I don't know.He's very nice.I'm sure there are there nice people, but it doesn't seem possible.Well, it's going to be as nice as him in a sensitive and straight, you know, and as honest and righteous.my heartYeah.What do you mean heart?Yeah, sorry.Yeah, perhaps all this confusion is because of or not.It's always been there but it keeps it comes to the service because of the fact that just emailed me.I still don't get that stupid person.You know, I really should just send him an email saying we cannot be touched for a few years.He was in India for a couple months while still but yeah, he sent me somewhere email.I don't know how I told you this he sent me this weird to email like a month ago or something just like a link of a YouTube video like a song.We had a weird a misogynist Shades.I thought I was like ask David.He saw the email he was like I was like, whatever do you think this means we were listening to the song he was like, well, we just exchanged, you know, very mundane email.How are you?What are you doing?How are your parents would have you seen I was right.Maybe this was a little too revealing in my feelings right.Sounds you revealing or no?I don't want to reveal so yeah, but if I say, I just want to see the city Through Your Eyes is that like sport rain or is thatyeah, but I mean he didn't respond for like 20 days or something and then he responded not directly to anyting anything but you just sent me a bunch of pictures of some director Kaweah scan from a book.He was reading.So I also ignored you know, and then this week he wrote back.Did you get the pictures?I was like no go away and then I was like, yeah, I did.Thank you and I meet again started exchanging email.So I mean, it doesn't really damaged play Havoc with my emotions.You know, like I keep thinking maybe there's a chance, you know, I know I shouldn't think that and should move on and how much time is passing all that.Yeah, I mean, it's been a year.Why can't I just get over I guess I was over like until he contacted contact me.I try not to think about it and think less and less then as soon as he does like all of its back.So maybe it's just too soon to know.Maybe it'll take me a couple years.I know it can't so.toastingAzanyeah.Yeah, I think we're both cozy.I don't either of us are driving and are breaking oryeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I think it is.Someone who doesn't take him in any direction the relationship is an autopilot, right?And you can just focus 98% on work and I don't find anything wrong with that.I used to be your God.I found that repulses.Maybe I still have I find it weird, but I've come to appreciate that because I know it takes I know what hard work is so he's cut out for ambitious thing question being as what you know, soNo, I don't.I don't I know they're there are people and I know them.But David is not one of them.No, I'm I was still stick by my statement that they don't have a lot of you know, we're almost time to do various said well, maybe they do some of them do but yeah, I don't know.I think it's time to ask my mother to be like, can you find some work even if it's like slightly meaning menial?I mean, I do have this fear that I'll find someone emotional and then it'll turn turn out that I don't want that either.So I'm pretty sure because like last year when I did go out on a few dates, I was always comparing the people to David and find them locking obviously.So I mean what I say emotional emotional emotional cuz it just that I'm too needy andit could be true.I mean like I might just be going through a weird phase and you know, if I'm strong enough that I won't need that emotional connection.wishful thinkingThat were true.Then you wouldn't have had to do anything different.You can just stay with Dave and do what's comfortable.Yeah.Why doesn't he make time for fun things?Why not?I'm tired.I'm really tired of having you know, stupid frivolous conversations with them seven years, and it's not a very ridiculous talking to him about anything on intellectual or just funny and I go with all this you get this answer this.And I know I'm stupid and soYeah.What?Yeah.yeahmaybe that's true I mean I'm not making it up but I I guess it's an objectively appreciate it not emotionally it's like this is a really righteous product it was good sitting thereI'm eating with my roommate today and I feel like I want to askBecause like I think a couple people will be moving.So I'll ask who they are and it's an expensive place and I don't like the location but I guess I've seen I found people in the community who had because I think I was telling you right like this mother daughter.So the daughter is you know 36, so if she's old much older than me, like she's she says, you know, she'd rather be alone and you know, and she doesn't mind that and I think maybe I'll be okay with being alone because like several months ago November and December I would not have been able to say that I could be okay with being alone.I'm terrified of that.So but maybe not so much now, I don't know I could distract myself with work, soI do.Well, I have like Community people now.I mean, I don't like I mean I care about that.Being but in a general sense, we don't connect emotionally not all the time.Yeah.actuallywell, I likeWell, like I I like connections like with my roommate.I definitely have an emotional connection.She and I we get each other like all roommates do like that woman the mother and daughter we connect emotionally, but also is AlexaYes, it's funny.I want to keep reading down just so I can be nurtured like that.What is real fun that intensity?It's fun, but it's also ridiculously embarrassing.Yeah, I guess if I get more that, you know on regular basis, maybe I won't feel like breaking down all the time.Yeah.Maybe not every day every week.Yeah.I don't know about David does it maybe he's just a very strong person.But I feel like I want that proverbial and literal piece of pie like he doesn't you see him right like read them.Literally he's right then and he has no not much of an appetite for food or life or emotions.Mine is much bigger.Thank you.YouTubeIt smells like somebody got sick or Victor something.Okay, you got a bunch of them?What lotion do they make slime with cereal as well?Write something like that, you know shovel the snow as well.Let's see.What did we talked about last time?It was quite significant, right?Oh, yeah the need to protect my mom.Well, I guess after that like if you feel you want to protect someone does that in your head make them feel or seem like the Catalyst.I don't know if that is a connection that's mainly in my head or not.It's funny like this didn't even occur to me until now that you know, why does she have to listen to all that view?Why couldn't why couldn't she have stood up for herself?And you know, I told him to shut up and you know last name, why does she keep you know, I don't know what you know kind of general and everyone feels and what is peculiar to me and I should think of getting rid of of thinking differently about I guess, you know, everyone would want to everyone was so protective about their parents in the people that love but I guess I my case it feels I guess it feels helpless maybe and I don't really trust her to do things for herself.I don't know and when she does do something by ourselves, then you know, I'm pleasantly surprised.Well, you don't need my help.That's a really I guess it's just like how a parent feels when they're bringing up a child.Finally.She went to the potty by herself or something like that.What I probably assume that.Yeah.What do you mean?I suppose I let you know we're all we're both in a trajectory of growth or you know, trying to achieve something and she with her teaching license and me with that, you know, like writing themselves.So I feel like both of us will you know, she will, you know, eventually get the lay of the land or something in order to not yeah, maybe that makes me think that you know, she's on a trajectory of changed the most people think otherwise, they think that this is where we are.This is how it will always be you orYeah.Maybe yeah, when was the reflection of the other may be enough for myself?I want to change and I want things and go on to achieve certain things and I'm hoping you know those achievements will make me more positive more confident person to have your person.I guess I'm assuming and hoping for the same for my mom.I just asked the way I think of it me.A work-in-progress.Yeah, it's you know, I mean, I think that's the word transition and it's because we're here and you know immigrants I kind of I don't know if I would have felt as an Indian.The thing is that adds to the sentiment patients that I have is myself mostly and my mom to just get there already perhaps I think that you are the only people who transitioning or trying to achieve something.I think others already have it even though now I'm beginning to see but not feel that like, you know, they're already actually also trying to get somewhere.Really?Probably everything people come to their depressing memes there in a place.They don't want to be changed his thoughts and feelings may be like situations.I guess.I don't know why I feel like I should just you know without hard work and all of that just you know, make it magically and sensible.Oh, yes, and I don't know.I just don't understand why people are very positive.It's like why are you so why do you have such a good solid realistic Sans and why you get through yesterday?I went to school and had to meet the professor.My professor is a writer.How do you say very teacher good teacher writing, but if only I could get him to focus.I think I could learn something from him.He kind of asked me about my background and I really didn't want to share and after I told him no, I mean a little bitOh, I think I could learn something from him.He can I mean a little bit a few things.I just felt really bad about myself, you know ashamed.Yes, you know me questions.Okay.Why are you doing this?Why are you doing that in class?He was like, do you guys, you know hang out together more?I was thinking he has no idea about the sense of resentment some of us may feel for each other.You know what maybe I sent another actually nice and happy with each other.I roll my eyes at you like a clear distinction between Rider course, you don't have to work and writers he doing why you should think that I'm so proud and I thought, you know, like very pathetic about myself.I'm like, yeah, I'm working.I came to this country since I was 15.So I was like kind of you to take that into account that's not important to me at all that I were despised that I despise those years.I don't know why I'm such a childish about this is that the right word adjectives.Use the wrong word.I should be I don't know.He said take an account that you'll have to work.It's like you said those who you know live off trust funds and don't have to work on those who have to work.He was just saying be appreciative, you know writers these days live in the Boston and trying to make it trying to write because it's so expensive here and this and that.Yeah, I don't know what it means to take into account.Yeah, how am I supposed to take it into account?Keep telling myself?That's okay.This is not a very nice consolation prize.I like the website.You almost said.Yes.I thought that it said yes, but it said now it's just in the back of my head.I'm feeling you know, what you guys are just using you know, what you don't care one bit about what I'm really want and I just need to send five or six emails everyday do this do that.Do this do that.It's like, you know.Yeah, I feel like the mule or you know, like a beast of burden just carrying on without really having a say in it.I thought so angry so wrong to hearing that.I was led to believe that they are accepted it and then suddenly they said no and so I just felt really wrong.I think he said that I felt like something that was given to me had been taken away or something and then instead crying and eating myself.I just yeah, I guess that I thought they were saying they're so busy and all that.Maybe I'll relieve their burden and do something nice for that.I'm just get to know, you know this horrible monsters and you know, they're heartless group in mind that you know, so and that's what they look like.You know, let's see it from their eyes.Maybe I'll learn something.Yeah, I know.I just feel like I mean see that as a negative thought process that I should learn how to avoid I volunteered and I was thinking with will this take too much of my time.And you know, I just went ahead and did it.So now I shouldn't regret it or not like beat myself up over it.I should learn to manage and I should you not learn to speak out for myself.Like, you know, I cannot help you these days.I'm busy and I'm feeling so wrong and then taken advantage of because you know, I knew what I was getting into.I don't know the feeling in my head.I don't know.It's just automatic.I can't explain it because that's just how I think or thought of that time purple just starting any everything on me and the emails.They said that they needed help with the website not addressing me.It was like an internal conversation and that person is forwarded to me.Yeah, I mean, like I said, I thought that if I relieve them of some of the burden then they'll sometimes will free up or they'll you know take pity on me and or not pretty but you know, like I'm feel obliged to reconsider reread a revision or they'll just see that I'm a nice person.Maybe I don't know yet that stinky.Yeah, like if someone you're angry withAnd it has maybe wrong you actually not, you know, just in your head runs you but actually runs you if they had a very kind of thinking like, you know, you made them feel bad for you you appeal to their conscious.I'd like to think.Yeah, perhaps are you appeal to their kindness?Is there monsters in my head I made them monsters are not actually monsters.Right?I said those words what they're really are monsters, aren't they?Like my dad, you know, there's no need to appeal to this anyting perhaps only two, you know.Yeah, I know but so they said that to resubmit and so when I do resubmit it wouldn't just oh well, who is this?It's the women who was giving us the fusible website, you know, there will be that sense of obligation a little bit.Right?I mean, they won't just go read the peace differently, I think.At this point I don't care.I feel like I'm convinced of this mad because I have commitment I shouldn't say that.Well, like, you know people have like other writers and like readers and liked it.So I know it's on Merritt that is important to be.Oh, yeah.It's so much of what gets published doesn't mean the PDF of the latest version the person that I was supposed to be and it's all mostly their friends.So, you know, it's whatever, you know, they all think they're you know, they launched a website launched a magazine that is going to be so so you got to work and you know, I'm giving voice to writers who are writing important things who are those Riders their their friends.So at this point I don't care if they get out of guilt or obligation or relief or likeNo, I'm not sure that the choice I mean.No, I mean.Yeah, perhaps know it's really is just in my head that I wanted to know them because if I didn't get to know them better, I'll think all the editors will just continue to be heartless monsters in my head.So I wanted to rid myself of that word assumption.I don't I haven't got to know them that well, I think I'm getting better very slowly.Yeah, they are.I don't know them that well at all actually.Probably not.I see them is more helpful since I really don't know anything about technology and all these things in my eye on all these ideas in my mind and no idea how to do them and what other their feasible or not.It just makes me feel very bad because I mean the whole friends thing looking at whoever else are you going to solicit the right there and you seen the writing and you like them or maybe you feel like in different ways, but I don't know it I just feel like there is no space for my voice, you know, like I mean, of course, you know, like Americans are going to want to read stuff written by Americans other Americans, but then it just feels like when will I get to be the commentator, you know, like I'm also writing about immigrants live and you know, like most people their publishing are American and then we need that, you know, it just feels like you know, you're not going to be a part of that thing you feel excluded all the time.So yeah, I don't know if I see them losses monsters.I don't know if I'd resubmit.I just want to get done with the website and do my own stuff at the time.Yeah, it was funny kind of relationship and I have not just with them but like the other things at large I just you know, I felt excluded for so long that then I also had this other contradictory feeling now, if you know, I don't know if I want to be in you know, because the whole like the few meetings that I have with them about the website and a one-time the guy said, oh I should invited you to the kid next time and we have a party or something and then I just kind of went since I was like, oh, I don't know if I want to do that.So I want to be included and I don't want to be included.I feel like they will take away my uniqueness or the things that makes me or something.I don't want to lose it.I guess that's a fair somewhere feeling that I have about traveling in the US.I don't really like to do it.I don't want to go on long drives like driving down the highway experience.I don't know just so monotonous.I feel really affected by its like the death by landscape.Yeah, and I feel even more wrong when I think of my mom and me and like us together struggling and wanting and me wanting to represent struggle with words and having included in the larger narrative American life and that not being you know, so I feel wrong.What do you mean?So are you suggesting I should submit them or?Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm watching this position and I don't know what to do or change it.I would really like to change it because I don't think I would succeed before I have to inject.I just want to see my own faults and they are they're not just behave early but in my writing my professor took one look at the first couple paragraphs and was like, oh this story is great.You have to do this to make the language better.So it's like they're there their objective and I just wantjust don't see the them and the University was the first time that I actually felt very included my God.I was so spoiled.I was really really spoiled because like the teacher really like my work and they gave me that award and then I said, oh I'm going to drop out.I can't pay my fees.They gave me 5000 to be able to finish and I was really just I was just at the Center of My Universe.Very good.I was you know on cloud nine because I was pampered appreciated and loved I was blinded by all the love.I can see the others the fact I mean I could and you know, there was all this politics People Reno King's favorites and all that but I hear it.I have a cremation, you know, you're not so much because you know, I've already been disillusioned and I'm kind of carrying that disillusion with me.So and I am very I don't know why you're gone.I can see the others and I can see the good in their writing and then had the sense of you guys are American obviously a very quickly because you're actually are the narrative, you know, you weren't invited.I have to kind of do acrobatics in bed myself in weird ways to seam or to show that I belong or are you now, I have something interesting to say I was thinking that yesterday.I felt very bad that I was thinking that way.I mean, I agree.That's what I would say.But then why is it that people don't want to read about it?because there's a lot of stuff the stuff that gets published mostly from Americans not from like immigrants like, you know, Asian Americans or you know,yeah, I would like to see that makes me feel very debilitated.I would think the other way because it's stuff that I cannot change myself except through improving my writing.I don't know.No, I don't think that I've changed be like that's the reason why I'm feeling sad because that's my professor said yesterday making a website will not result in publication, you know, it will result in contacts but not in publication and I know I mean that's why I don't even know if I'll submit it again because then they'll think of now, you know, she will think we're obligated to her which you know, I don't feel that at all.I just feel like I said, I just think I wonder if they're reading a piece a second time and if at least I have done the changes that make it more powerful in the other language and all the issues are taken care of then they'll know that the piece was written not when stranger because that makes it very easy for you to reject if it's bad, you know, but the certain he does On the Border, you know, because I feel like now I've been on the board for a long time it really is.Like it.It's like coming to Mexico and not being close to the Border.But now I'm on the fence so they will see that okay.It's not mean this person is someone who has helped out.Is writing that I'm at fault in instead of out and if it is and if indeed I fall out, maybe they will they will give me some feedback as to how I could be and you know, I don't know like this piece is not even that important to me because you not working on my model and it would have been so nice to have a magazine publication.Yeah, so they're supposed to be my mother.Like my mother makes me feel.That's a negative way of thinking and damaging and everything.I don't know if the patient is concerned house to she wants to know how sick she is.Yeah.Yeah, I should.About what?Yeah, I mean I'm so deep into it that I don't completely know that yes, I'm strong.So now that you kind of I think what you're saying is wrong and maybe I will be able to get out of it.Yeah.It does actually a little bit just because I'm really good at it and they are very happy with it.And they're encouraging are there saying, you know good job with that.You know, there is that there is a affirmation I feel good probably doing it.But then when this negative thinking comes into being that oh, you know, they're just using me they wouldn't want to publish me.This is when I feel miserable.I mean, you're right.I do feel miserable, but I have that positive sense as well.Okay.Is that insurance thing?I did.It's just impossible to get through to them because all I could do was leave them a message about my personal changed her about my address changed and I don't even know if they processed it.I didn't even get to talk to a person.Yeah, I'll keep trying.Yesterday went a little better eventually.Sometimes I have something to start with in my head and I have a couple of likes cars running in my arm.That we're almost faded into my arms are getting tan and I've gotten much darker and that's bothering me.But oh, well, I don't know what I'm going to do.I feel like when I want to hurt myself the knowledge that like that is not going to go away necessarily doesn't actually isn't enough to keep me from doing it away from us, but like well socks and I have scars all over me sort of preoccupation about it.You know when I think that I like some things in life are never going to go away.It's just going to be what I look like then I feel like I should either find some way to get comfortable with them or find some way to talk about them about like I've got two although it's never going to go away.So there's not much Orijen see about that.I just find it embarrassing because like I self-insure and I'm kind of embarrassed about it like it's just you and I must, you know thing I've ever done and I can't sort of like pretend I have done or I don't know because it's right there in front of me all the time.I guess.I just worry that people like will always see it as unstable in the way it has been.Guess I'll just have to wear sunscreen.I was at a party with andWhite wires and so there were a lot of kids running around everywhere and there was a kiddie pool set up until it was like everybody putting our bathing suits and sunscreen in the whole process and somebody told me like the pre pre Tanya time.For damage that would lead to skin cancer in life is like 0 to 5 anyway, so I'm screwed.I don't think I put on sunscreen until I was at least 10.Oh well.I mean, I guess that is good that I actually am thinking about myself in 20 30 50 years, but not necessarily that hopeful peaceful thoughts.So my church has decided that this coming year is going to be like the year of the Bible and they're going to focus on actually reading the Bible which actually could do that much and especially like the Old Testament because there seems to be a general consensus that no one really knows what is in there anyway, and it makes them kind of embarrassment, So, you know, I think that's a good idea and I've been anxiously turning over in my head whether it should offer to help in some way because I actually do know a lot about that Old Testament.And I don't really know it's a big church still like program like these have like amazing hierarchies in bureaucracies.And it kind of like said that this was we're going to do and no one said anything else.They're not like going to start it up in September and I don't know if I'm ever going to be here on September 3rd of excuse I hear myself makingbut it's really anything involved with the church.I felt like two days working myself up to sending an email telling the priests you preach this week that I like to Sturman and I'd be like now he's really not going to be upset about like to hear that.They do things.Well, no, it's fine Tanya.It's a little weird going.So my the church I grew up in is also called calorie, which is weird because Calvary I think is kind of weird, but it's like whatever but I was not liking some place.I felt comfortable like the space.I was really comfortable in like both in like Sanctuary like the church in Shelton like all like the whole area.I just played there a lot because we let literally across the street from it.And so we just ended up playing like in all the storage closets and things which I'm sure we really fine for the people who actually wanted the store thing there but whatever.But like I never really felt comfortable with any of the people that I remember it was weird.So I'm not really good at about remembering people's names as a child.And so there we were like this whole the third of the congregation.I never knew their name and I saw them every week and I known them for years and I was supposed to know their names and I don't know their names and I couldn't say who is that person without I basically solve that problem by leaving town and now I just I like fuck it.I'm not going to be embarrassed about it.Like I'm asking people's names when I forget that because otherwise I'm screwed.We're going to have a year-long relationship and I don't know who they are.I don't know.It's like how I know some parts but like how much bridge and a congregation run like really intimately in some parts to scare the shit out of me like talking to other people, you know, it's really nice to feel like I really know people in the car when I go home and not talk to anybody else cuz that scary.you know and also because like worship is usually a pretty like emotionally heavy time for me and it's so it's hard for me tosnap out of it.Yeah.I'm trying to remember like anyplace this world come from and I guess I remember like the Cavalry I grew up in the congregation as being very cool in some ways.You know when you grow up in a vest Street not best rated Vestry is a place where people that are the executive order in the rectory, which was across the street, which is belt.I think in like to 1810 so it's like a big old plantation style house Scott.I like a dog run and it was just like sort of a shuffle actually it was maintained well at all in some ways it was fine.And in some ways it was not fine and like, you know, there was really no, you know, it was a really old house.There are no central air cleaning up all of course.I like it would get so hot in the summer and my bedroom is on an additional.So if you have much hotter than the rest of the house because it was like it was either brick or stone that the house is much cooler than it had any right to be in general.My room is like 5 degrees hotter than anywhere else and I would guess so hot that I set up a fan right at the end of my bed and it would still be so hot that I couldn't sleep.So I get a bowl of ice and just like there was no fan in the bathroom.So there was a mold all over the ceiling and I got to be this very heavy intricate pattern mold and I remember just being in the bathroom looking at like who this is interesting look at the pattern.Eventually at some point Maya.What I realize that most people's bathrooms like when that happens just repaint but that's isn't really what happened for us like our dog.That was a German Shepherd was deathly afraid of thunderstorms was like, I like tired of answering a thunderstorm last couple of banister rails and like that never got replaced ever.So water made me throw up.Yeah, it took me a long time to notice the connection that if I drink a whole lot of water, I would throw up a couple times.I minutes afterwards and I like Scott.With everything but that was because it happened to Tim not because I happen to me because it was said and that wasn't really listen to it all and it was because we had well water and the wild Hunt contract or like wasn't be maintained properly.And then right before we moved out they sound like it was like a storage place in Fond Du Pre much every year and they're like, oh there's dangerous bull down here.We need to fix it because boys meet you and I was like, that's where we used to play in the summer because it was too hot upstairs.You know, I think part of that and the thing is the housing block on my dad belongs to the street and they weren't responsible for the upkeep.Yeah, typically apart of the priest salary.I mean these days this year we're from those message and they have included a stipend for housing.But it kind of like traditionally the priest lives in the rectory and then the Vestry use directory up or the church does the church's responsibility and so like I don't feel so good about that, you know, they started doing repairs the last couple years we lived there but I think it was because I started to realize that my dad was going to be there forever and I neededBut you know, my dad's part of me says that.Was also the way he was raised like that was the way his parents like his parents house was like that but much worse except the house.I lived in as far back as I can remember was newer so they didn't have stuff like the structural kind of things but none of the dishes were ever clean sort of thing.Well if you just didn't noticeno, no, he should not have noticed.So like going to church is really important to me being a part of a church or something.That's a little more not necessarily a Caring Place.Yeah.I mean your job is sort of the opposite.There's a phrase from gaudy night, which is when I really likeDorothy else tires.It's a mystery novel from the thirties.The female protagonist has been anxious with the mail Pro, you know, she's sort of in love with this guy but like he doesn't want to get married because she doesn't want to be in a position of being limited for a limited by your husband which looks like protecting and is afraid after a letter she gets that he was being about as protective as a can opener.I like that a lot.Yeah, she's a great writer.I like that.Yeah, I guess so.I'm sorry I'm trying to take this seriously and it's getting increasingly difficult yeah I read that book a whole lot probably 10 times and I don't think that ever occurred to meabsolutelyyeah yeah it's like the correspondence is important for the character that she realized this is part of her being like she like basically one of the questions of the book is how do you reconcile the life of the mind with relationships particularly with your woman and your so basically like she sent him like she's a detective but she's the one who has been commissioned to solve this mystery she likes him a letter saying hey I'm working on this problem and it's like getting increasingly dangerous to see how it goes and he writes back and says basically well it seems like you're doing really good work let me know if I can help and that was the opposite response than she expectedLet me step in and take care of this for you.Sorry.So as soon as I said that I was like, oh wow next to talk about the context and that's going to happen up a open up a whole can of worms.Oh, I know.I don't know.I don't know.Like I'm not sure how much the contact carries over for me.So I don't have to have this reaction where you say something in the conversation where I'm sort of like well, I don't know if that's true.But that's just really elegant whether it's true or not seems to be really secondary 200.That's a really good idea.I guess I'm sort of dodging the question now.Yeah.I don't think well see here's the thing.I don't think talking about this guy is like I think the analogy breaks down or the image breaks down because like I caught myself so I don't have to do this.This is my Charter and more painful.I don't feel like cutting myself is to exert some control over the situation and I feel like this conversation is filing rap for the out of my control.but now I have to deal with the scars that open the app toyes.But in some ways it's like and so this is where I like to see the masculine plays until like in some ways.This is also like this kind of discomfort is very familiar.Well, it hurts a lot.So I must be doing something right.Yeah, and then some sense you kind of arranged it that way really?Well, you consciously would choose the cutting as a way of coping something that has a kind of narcissistic quality or experience that you may not choose consciously, but as like a can opener like I think you're exactly right that there is because what feels familiar is what gives you the impression for some reason that you're doing something right?I don't know what the alternative is.sometimes I just stare atwhat's what I like I meant by not clean specifically but like I don't it's hard for me to like imagine if we inhabit the mental space to somebody that didn't think that way I didn't have this whole approach to wanting help and wanting comfort.I can't imagine what it's like for other people.Which I'm usually pretty good at that sort of thing.Yeah.Yes.You know, it's a little more challenging for you that is when it's in the other for like other people in like but it's pretty clear to me that you have a better sense of what's going on in that for instance.My dad ever did or ever will.So it takes a lot of transfer unit trust an assassin.Okay.Yeah, good luck.Haha, and you know, let me know what I can do.So we went to visit him at the stake house yesterday took the kids to work with her.She kind of she suggested that something that she thought would be nice and that morning and she's like, I'm really not motivated to go to work and I was like, you should take the kids with you a little bit Roth like Mary had been difficult or things have been difficult for her whatever anyway, and he was like not really was really fancy stuff and I don't like fancy stuff.Okay, so I sort of thought a lot yesterday about what we talked about on Wednesday and then kind of put it all the way out of my head.I think what I came to was.Yeah.I think you were really really write that like I'm saying this is how things are and kind of disavow mean a lot of the ambiguity there and a lot of the know this isn't how things always are.I'm not sure how much of that is coming from being angry was one of those things that is very hard to think about which I feel like probably means that there's something there, you know, I kind of like my mind certifies off of it.I feel like this case a lot of it is so I think I got really scared by the side that like, none of the things that usually works to help me.We're working and maybe it's easier to say this is predictably always the case and then it's not always the case, but I don't really know why things get so bad some days and not about other days and I don't have any way that I can to make a difference.One thing.I thought was interesting was like analogy and like it would never have occurred to me to think that people who are talking about sports all the time when it wasn't interested.We're like being rude like that was an echo of like, oh that makes sense.It was like what you know, so I don't know ya things have not been so hard the last couple days.So that's good.Yeah, but again, like I don't know why this is where it's like most of it feels like most of the things that most of the like therapies that I was in the hospital Burberry, like coping your towards coping skills, which makes sense.This is where all that breaks down because I feel like I'm actually getting pretty good at that part.I like at saying when I do this this results, when I do this this results, like what are the ways that I can change my environment to help me like I've gotten to where that sort of high on my priority list and it's something that I work on actively and it's something that I'm not terrible and then sometimes it just doesn't work.Yeah, because you know if it doesn't work, but I'll need to talk to you about it.I don't need to plan Earth would I come in and say these are my small victories of the last days butyeah, you know and also angry at everybody else who you know both people for whom like once they learn how to use these coping skills like that actually fixes things.I'm not sure if those people exist but people certainly talk like those people.Yeah, I guess I feel like I feel like I've been set up to believe that when these things fell for me.That means that I'm a failure and part of me sees this as to stop by that and part of me believes that you know, sorry, I don't have to actually clean my glasses.I just write them on my shirt whichever shirt.I'm wearing which leads me to never having glasses.Yeah.I feel like I'm failed and I feel like I I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me.Like I'm deformed in some way or something similar to talk today about whatYou just asked me like how much I was talking with people about the ECT.Well, then, you know sort of depends on the day and who I'm talking to but actually kind of a lot which led into you know conversations about like is there a stigma surrounding mental illness?What does it look like?Like I have somewhere I was headed and I don't remember.Oh, yeah, I think I guess I don't think this is a very nice thought but it's something like undeserved suffering scares the shit out of people.How do they deal with it?You know, I guess I mostly see that argument made in talking about like sexual harassment raisin, like blaming the victim a lot of my Facebook friends well and art like, you know aren't readers of Jezebel.That's why I kept reading a lot about it and I sort ofGo back and forth.It's like I don't it scares me when I don't feel like I have done something to deserve what's happening to me.So that's yeah, it scares me last one, you know things got to be okay again, and I don't feel like I've done anything to deserve that you somehow I sort of got over that.Haha or think about it last or yeah, you know, that's not really something I can like talk to people about because this sort of knee-jerk response of like that things get better for yourself and I'm like good for you.You should be run like hell.Yeah.I'm very proud of a lot of things but sometimes like sometimes it just happens or it feels like it just happened.Yeah, maybe if I look at it too closely.Well, I'm doing well without to make it go away where to get spices and you know on the way back there's beer there's a bar and it had some of the signs outside and it said like good news ladies alarm bar.Stop a single and I would like to laugh and then I was like that's actually kind of sexual harassment and I was like, I don't know until I talk to James about it and it's like well, you know I sawThink it's funny and I want to think it's funny.But like now I can't let go of seeing it as kind of creepy witch, you know, James can let go of those things.I think you know me a hard time about not being able to go because you know, he certainly knows it's really not.Okay, but I'm not really sure the connection is there something is like sometimes I just you know, like I want to be able to laugh at the joke or like listen to the song without that it's coming on every single radio station without actually that's really kind of a song about date rape and that's probably not.Okay.Yeah, but I also like don't want to be full of rage and exhausted better by all these things.I hate you ever, you know, every hour of the day, so I don't I told you about the and I want to talk with him.You said that becoming a field agent really helps him get in touch with the rage.Is that right?Okay.Oh, that's okay.Yeah a couple months ago.Are like earning a PhD in theology really helps get in touch with his rage?I think that wasYeah, I feel like it's I don't know.I guess I'm sort of circling about thinking about anger and some things it's like I have to sort of step back for me being angry about just because like it will make me last then I want to be your make me less of myself and I want to be like, it's just exhausting and I don't know it just has to be done.I guess I'm thinking mostly about like feminism right now.Yeah that's being angry about it gets to where it hurts me rather than helps me and then some things I don't know.It's like it's bearable to consider myself as somebody who's angry about things.That's how they used to be.Well, I guess the important thing I get to decide once I'm done being angry.I would like when James tells me that I should be done being angry about feminism that it doesn't go well.That's not helpful, and it doesn't end well for him.I don't know.I don't know.Yeah, I guess I feel like there's like some big gap or like something that I'm not seeing or not taking account of or taking into account when you know, since I can't see it.I don't know where to look.I don't know.Yeah, I don't know in a sense.I feel like you know, what a lot of the time I feel like sex is also something that just sort of happens and I like happens to everybody and we don't know how to get out of it.And I think about somebody like Ted this guy that I room with you.Like I'm pretty sure he was a sociopath like you just did not give a shit about anybody like you just did not care and I don't know.I don't know.\"]"

I'm one of the psychiatrist who work here in the department of psychological medicine and you are.I've spoken with your physician doctor green and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today.However, I would like to hear from you and why you have come to see me today.Would you like to tell me about your troubles with cleaning checking and Counting and what you feel will happen?If you don't do these if you have questions or don't understand something at any point during this interview, please feel free to ask for clarification.Are you comfortable telling me about your trouble specifically?Are you a person who is careful about safety?Is there anything in the house that you have checked on frequently.Do you have to do the same thing over and over again or in a certain way?What do you feel what happens if you do not do these things over and over?How many time how many times do you wash your hands a day?Do you find that you need to change your clothes more than once a day?How many times are you checking the locks on your doors windows?How about your sleeping habits?Have you had any trouble with sleep?Do these actions seem reasonable to you or more

job?before your mother passedHave you ever had ideas of suicide or homicide?Were you treated for depression or any other mental issues in the past such as after your mother's passing?Would you be willing to try medication cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure and response prevention therapy to begin changing these behaviors?According to dr. Green's records and MRI shows negative in blood work looks normal.So we will begin today and I will follow up with you in one week.Hello there.I'm one of the new physicians in the practice.First of all.What would you like me to call you?Okay, right.So what is it about that brought you to see me today?Yeah, yeah, I understand that.You've been in to see him a few times over the last few months.Would you mind if I asked you to go over again what the problem is perhaps in your own words so that I can get an understanding of it.Right and you're feeling a little bit anxious just here with me.Right take your time.So your heart starts to race.It really beats fast.And you feel like you can't catch your breath.Is that right?How long is this been going on for?Right.Okay, and can you remember what happened to start it all off?Laugh sounds like quite an unpleasant experience for you at the time.And when was that happening to you?Oh and when that was happening to you when you were in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on?You thought you were having a heart attack?Okay.Right.So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?And other things what sort of other things are you not doing?Personal things okay.I guess I'm wondering if you're talkin about your sex like there.Right.So you're avoiding sex and a case that it puts your heart rate up.Okay, how's that affecting things between you and your husband?So it sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether.But it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well.Is that right?Okay, so just so that I've got the story straight this all began about six months ago before I that had you had anything like this.So just to make sure I've got the right way around it if you can 6 months ago pressure work.You went to town you had the first of these attacks and then since then you've had some more of them.And now it's kind of got to the point where you don't want to go out.You don't go out to town by yourself.Right, you're not going to the pub.You're not socializing like you used to.And you're avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and that's having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship.Okay.Okay.I'm looking at you.I know you've had an ECG.What have you been told about the results of that?So even though the doctor told you there's nothing to worry about with your heart.Do you still worry that there might be something wrong with your heart?Well, I think I'd agree with the doctor.I don't think there's anything wrong with your heart.The reason I say this is that you had an ECG which is come back perfectly normal.And usually if there was a problem with the heart that you said you would pick something also you got none of the risk factors really for heart disease because you don't smoke your blood pressure from what I gather from your notes has always been fine.You're fairly young before this you're pretty sitting active.And also I know you're worried about your dad haven't had a heart attack, but actually he was a lot older than you are and so you're not really in the same respect as he would have been so I don't think that there's a problem with your part.I guess what I'm wondering is whether actually what's going on is a little more with the doctors thought weather actually.This might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms.Have you ever thought it might be something else rather than a heart problem?Right.Okay, the anyone explain to you about anxiety and panic attacks.What we have on top of our kidneys is to little glance and they're called her adrenal glands, right and they produce a hormone called adrenaline.Have you heard of that?Okay, and when adrenaline does is It prepares us for situations of fight or flight.Is that a Charmy perhaps remember for biology at school?Do you remember what we need my fight or flight?Yeah, your body starts of chiggers.To do it.That's exactly it and what's released to allow you to do.The fight or flight response is the adrenaline right?So when your body needs you to get ready to do something it searches out of a lot of adrenaline and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action, right?So it does things like a guess your heart rate up.I guess you're breathing speed up so that you're ready to run and can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry.It can sometimes make people feel a little bit light-headed.Are those the kind of symptoms that you getOkay, what often happens with people with panic is that the first time it happened the first of gentle and release occurs out of the blue and perhaps it time to stress and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work you feeling a bit stressed out and in town.It was a bit hot.So that may have been what it was behind that first attack.What happens if people is that once they've had one panic attack, they're going to have more and the reason that is that once you had something like that happen to you.You're kind of their thinking will this happen again?Is that something that you do?You're describing it exactly.That's what we call hyper-vigilance.So you're their kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart.And for most of us are heart rate will go up and down all throughout the day but most of us don't worry about it because we don't notice it but because you had a panic attack your there thinking what's my heart doing?And then there the minute it starts to change you clock it you notice it and then you start to get anxious thoughts.So you might start worrying.Right, so you get these kind of anxious thoughts.And they're very frightening.And because you're thinking Goodness Me could my heart stop that's making you more anxious and that causes even more adrenaline to be released and that makes the symptoms even more pronounced and that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you.Does that make sense as to what that might be happening?One of the things that you have been doing which is something a lot of people do with anxiety is that you started to avoid doing things that trigger at all.Exactly and Willis in the short-term that alleviate your symptoms because you don't have to get panicky what's happening as at the more you avoid to do things the less likely you are to ever get around to ever finding out whether or not anything really happened.Does that make sense?Well, if we are starting to tackle this as if it were an anxiety problem.The number of approaches we can think about tables we can think about other kind of talking approaches.There are pros and cons to those and side effects that we need to discuss.So I'm just slightly watchful of the time.We seem to be coming to the end of today's discussion for the appointment.What I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week and look again more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best.How would that sound?Any other questions before we finish?That's fine.I'll see you next week.Where do you want to start?What's going on?What are you feeling and then I want to know when it started.So you're feeling really irritable.How often is this year?How long have you slept?So there are good days a couple of good days in a row and then a couple of bad days.Typically a more common descriptor of depression is having those really low feelings pretty consistently.Nobody has a textbook people's experiences don't fit into boxes perfectly.What's really important is that you're feeling badly more frequently than you're comfortable with and more frequently than we would help.I'm encouraged that you have days where you get a break from those feelings, but I don't want you feeling really down a couple of days a week.Do you know what makes one day a good day and one day bad day?Saturday was a good day.You just had this feelingwhen you say you couldn't what were you feeling that stopped you?Some more anxiety than sadness or lethargy.When you're not feeling it it's hard to recall what you were feeling.Not remembering what your feeling or are you finding yourself forgetting?Are you forgetting this show up places where you're supposed to be?Do you find yourself losing things?But you got distracted.You felt good enough to be productive and die the wall.Right, that's something easily distracted.You mentioned having thoughts of self-harm.Can you describe the thoughts for me?Do you have a particular way of thinking about hurting yourself?Just a general hurt myself not do something specific.Have you ever done that?You don't act on it, but somehow the feeling passes because you're not feeling that in the moment now.What have you been taking formats?And have you needed or wanted to take additional Klonopin?That's all your regular regimen?So is that something you've never discussed with your psychiatrist?Is it okay for you to use additional Klonopin?Does it make you tired?o u rThese are maybe good questions to discuss whether or not it would be useful or beneficial to take more to take some of that additional Klonopin sort of on an as-needed basis or whether it would be better to switch to something else.These are good questions for discussion.See what backed you were at.I really don't know about that.In what ways do you feel like your medication is working?So that's a difference in your daily life.You're having to combat things like that.Right.It's not really an experiment to want to do this is not a controlled study.Yes.So you're not happy all the time.So you do feel like this is worse than whatever your Baseline is.o u rHow is that?She said you were really angry at Sydney about that.It's really uncomfortable feeling to have someone be angry.And he actually believed it wasn't a problem or you think he did it.I wonder how that impacted your mood this past week.How do you feel about this new information?You have to move to work on Newport.You're apprehensive about it.What is the great things about doing this work was to work in the field and make contact and start developing relationships with people that actually know your work.You have to live in RI proper.That's limiting and frustrating.You said scary and what I was about to say was I here for your creeping into your voice from other conversations that we've had.It's my belief that anticipating something scary being afraid feeling like you're not going to be competent or do something feeds into your episodes of anxiety or depression.Whatever we call it in the instant interesting makes you have anxiety and depressive symptoms.So I'm wondering how much of what you felt this past week is fueled by having your timeline laid out for you.The new information about the job didn't really speed up the timeline of looking for a job that actually sounds like they'll find work for you for a little bit longer than you may have anticipated.But at the same time that you started hearing about that or taking about that it sounds like you are you also got some advice online that you should be doing your job search now, I'm wondering how much that piece of advice that you got kind of got you ramped up and got you worried.Got you scared and got you feeling depressed because you did not like the job search process.Listen to this fear.feeling trappedfeeling trapped may be feeling judged by your parents worrying if they're going to be angry.We can't really know exactly for sure.You feel less overwhelmed.I don't think any one thing that happened in the environment or an event that or an event that happens causes feelings of depression, obviously anxiety and depression is something that you've struggled with off and on over the course of many years.There's not going to be one particular thing that causes all the all those symptoms.The way that you tend to respond to whatever stress life is full of stressors.And what seems to ramp up your symptoms is how you respond to whatever stressors there are whether it be having to look for an apartment having to look for a job feeling angry at a boyfriend feeling uncomfortable in your house having tension or conflict with your parents.These are all particular stressors that can go on in your life.What tends to make you feel better or worse is what control you have and how you respond to whatever stressors there are those dresses can be things that can that can ongoing and chronic or something more time limited like the move.What what do to the idea of brain chemistry?out of the bluebecause it feels out of proportion.That's about wanting to kill yourself or wanting to hurt yourself.Those are thoughts.I'm in complete agreement with you that some of these stressors that you just listed are things that for a lot of people wouldn't cause this level of distress and that's why we call it depression because you are feeling intense distress about things that for many people like you said would be upset and it might feel overwhelming but it wouldn't feel this intense.And you feel like you have absolutely no control over that.Stuff that changes this mysterious brain chemistry.There's no way to measure things that you hear about on drug commercials and on TV and they talked about serotonin levels and norepinephrine.There aren't really ways.We have to go in and measure what levels are or what the right levels are.It's an idea, but there aren't really the specifics things to do change mode for sure medication is one of them we kind of know from working backwards people take these drugs and have a lot of changes in their moods the other things that change mood or things to do.Are things that do take some of the motivation and energy things like exercising exposure to light?This time of year you tend to get enough anyway.It might not really be necessarily because when you're driving is that early enough that the sun's not out.But you're getting exposed to sunlight already.And so I don't think that that would.If you're driving when the Sun is up, there's enough exposure through being in the car.That's true.But for the most part being up and being out of the house, you're getting enough of that during the time of year this time of year, but that probably wouldn't make a difference you getting enough to be adequate just because you're up and out and you're in a car that has lots of Windows.Yes on a very gray overcast day.You might not but for the most part in summer, most people don't have no defects in the spring and summer due to lack of light absolutely talk to Doctor Barnes on Friday about medication issues the things that you have control over or exercise, which we know releases endorphins and thoughts, which might not cause a feeling of depression, but they can exacerbate it or help to alleviate it somewhat it's not saying that what you're thinking is necessarily the start of the symptoms, but it's something that you do have to you do have control over that can push it in One Direction or the other.We may not be able to prevent every symptom or every episode of depression.Our goal is to reduce the frequency and alleviate some of the intensity that you feel.To get Beyond safety.So, you know where you can keep yourself safe but to get yourself to a place where you actually feel better.That's where I really want you to be.I'm of course very glad that you're safe and that you don't have any attempt to act on these thoughts, but I do really want you to feel better.Does he argue against you?Does that help?so he doesn't really want to fight against it and you don't really want him toIs there something else that you could give him to say to you that would maybe be less taxing for him and more satisfying for you.And then you end up intensifying your own thought because you end up saying what you were already saying again, you're reinforcing it because you're fighting against him.I wonder if censoring yourself a little bit to get yourself the response that you want because when you tell him that you feel like killing yourself or you feel like hurting yourself, he's going to say it's not that bad.Don't do it, which doesn't make you feel better.You know that you're going to keep yourself safe.So you don't really need him to tell you not to do those things because it sounds like you're very clear that they are very big thoughts that you're not acting on if there is ever a point in time where you feel like you might act on them and you need to tell someone because you need them to take steps to get to some safe place.But if you know that their thoughts that you're not going to act on maybe what you want to say to him is I'm feeling really sad.Can I have a hug?I'm having a hard time right now.I'd feel better if we could cuddle.Maybe those are the things that you need to share with him.Well, maybe that's a plan to try thinking about what you say to elicit the kind of response that you want.Well, let's give it a try before we decide it's impossible.It sounds like what you want is some comfort not an argument.But he doesn't know what else to say.So he says it so if you can tell him what you want, I'm sad.I'd like a hug.Can you hold me?But it's not going to work for you.You need to speak each other's language, you know what works for him and you can give him what works that sounds like what you need to do is give him something that works for you that he can feed back to you if that's hugs or just sitting together then that's what it is.I'm glad we figured out something to try that might help.And you don't have to wait for it to be really bad.That's the other thing.Asking for a hug doesn't have to get to a point where you want to hurt yourself for before you ask your boyfriend for a hug.If there's ever a time when you don't feel safe, then you call me if I can't answer then you call the emergency room, but it sounds like it's not him who you tell about those thoughts.Especially if you know that they're just thought I know that they're uncomfortable to have but they don't need any action if there's ever a time when the thoughts turn into something that do I need action and you need someone to help you stay safe.Then you can either tell him that I need you to do this or you call me or call Emergency Services.Will you really needed that?And you know yourself.Well, I trust that ultimately you want to be safe and you take these the steps to do that right now you've gotRight.Now you've got your way of expressing how badly you feel give it a shot.Don't wait until it's really bad just practice asking for the hugs even if it doesn't get that bad so that we can train him to give that kind of support that you actually really want and let's see how that goes that I think we will then I think we meet next week at the same time.We do.I want to check and see on Monday the 22nd.We're scheduled at 2:30.Is it possible to switch to a Tuesday, or does that interfere with work?I do either one Friday the 19th or Friday the 26th.My schedule got a little thrown off for that month.So Friday the 19th.I can offer you the 1:30 or 2:30 or 3:30.We could also meet on Friday the 26th because I am away the week of the 29th to the 2nd, especially since you're feeling bad.It makes sense to have one every week.We can do the same thing the 2:30 on the 26th.And I will see you next Monday at 2:30 as well.This is your bill.Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrist to work you on the department of psychological medicine and you are.I have spoken with your physician doctor white and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today.However, I would like to hear from you and why you have come to see me today.Doctor white also indicated that you're having some other concerns.Would you like to tell me about your concerns other than sleep I would also add that if you have questions or don't understand something at any point during this interview, please feel free to ask me for a clarification.Are you comfortable telling me about your trouble specifically?Can you tell me when these symptoms started?Is there something a change within your life for a trigger that occurred that you recall before the symptoms?Began?Are you having any distressing memory is that you coming back or maybe a situation where you feel scared or really want to avoid?Do you ever have times of great fear or have panic attacks?Do you drink alcohol smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs?That is great that you have been sober for eight years.Do you have specific memories of this house as a child, are there any memories of pleasure or fear?Your family does not know about this abuse from your cousin.Do you know about family history or any mental illness or other medical issues?Was your husband physically or emotionally mentally abusive to you?Has anyone else sexually or physically abused you?What about your children?Have they been exposed to any of uses?How old are your daughters?Do you think the ages of your daughters May trigger some of your memories?How about mental or emotional abuse?Did you experience either or both of these?Have you had other therapy or medications in the past?Perhaps when you saw the counselors in the past?Yes, it does and that is a healthy action to take how about your irritability and memory issues I mentioned earlier.Can you tell me more specifically about the symptoms?how do you spell depressedHave you had feelings of suicide or homicide?Do you or have you ever had a suicide plan?Do you notice any symptoms or feeling jumping and anxious?Can you talk about the nightmares are they the same or different?5 hours of sleep is your average you say do you nap during the day?Is there something you are very concerned about or afraid of happening?What do you worry about?Can you tell me more about what you mean by your life Went Down Show?Where is the test called the ace study adverse childhood experiences study?Have you ever heard of the study or taking any test for depression?Are you taking any test for depression or trauma?How do you hurt a post-traumatic stress disorder?That is correct.There are other situations where people can have PTSD.So just traumatic stressful events such as car accidents living through a natural disaster witnessing traumatic events or living in abusive situations.There are some key symptoms such as re-experiencing the event arousal or hyper-vigilance and avoidance.These are symptoms.We have discussed today and we could come to me with treatment options if you are interested.No, everything here is confidential.There is a therapy that we could start called prolonged exposure therapy, which is just looking at the memories in a safe environment and trying to retrain Pathways in your brain.We could also look at some medications for anxiety and depression.Does this sound like something you would like to pursue?We're going to have some lab work done before we look at medications and we will be in treatment.Sorry, I'm late.If today was going to be the day that I was on timeGood morning.Gotcha.So, how did the diagnostic process go?Yeah.rightLike what?rightrightYeah, I know the diagnostic criteria.I'm a little skeptical of some of the source of questionnaires for this kind of thing.But whatever the bottom line is you try the medication and if it helps, that's great if it doesn't help then stop.I guess the main reason I wonder about it is difficulties with the intention and even organization can we relate to depression and anxiety as well?You know if somebody is depressed they have a lot more trouble focusing often times and so with paying attention and following through they tend to be a little less organized and just generally Less on top of things you can be difficult to differentiate which is which I guess the primary way of doing that would be there are a few ways to think about it.When would be through your history if you have ADD than the extent to which you have trouble focusing and trouble being organized should be fairly consistent through your history.Whereas if it's due more to depression than those sort of difficulty should increase or decrease along with the extent of your depression or anxiety.Do you know what I mean?That's well made to tell really the gold standard for diagnosing something like ADHD is neuropsych testing which is much more involved process that involves usually 6 or 8 hours of testing with a psychological psychologist.And then you know, the creation of a written report that is usually between 6 and 15 pages long or so and that's kind of the gold standard for this kind of diagnosis.But you know, you may have it and the questionnaires are a good in terms of day can be helpful and better than nothing.Like I said, the treatment implications are pretty straightforward and that's not a big hoss in any way associated with them.So you may as well try it.Whoever it is like a mental health provider.Okay as opposed toYeah, I would have yeah, I would have that diagnosed by you know, the best best is a neuropsychologist who does testing or at least a screaming the second best is an actual mental health clinician.It could be a social worker or psychologist or psychiatrist.what do you want me to stay somebody like aWell, it's a pediatrician who well, there are special developmental fellowships.I think where they I don't know a lot about it to tell you the truth.So maybe I I think they do more training and socio-emotional stuff.Well, II don't think I'm covering my ass because I don't have a stake in it, you know.I care about you in.and youRay okay.Right, but you're probably right aren't you?I mean they probably should.I'm saying that it can be difficult to diagnose add and people can often overdiagnosis.That's largely because there are other conditions that can result in the same symptoms.It's good to work with somebody who is more specialized the most specialized people are neuropsychologist II must specialized people are usually mental health conditions that work with kids.The third most specialized are pediatricians.Not that they're bad.It's just that pediatricians do 900 different things, you know, if you which are mental health, I guess that's what I'm saying.rightYeah, you know.every 6 year old boy who's cubbyIs a mess and who leaves stuff this is what I'm concerned about.If every six-year-old boy whose coming was a mess who lost us who didn't follow their parents directions who don't follow through what things was diagnosed with ADHD there would be probably three 6 year old boys and two of them who were asleep who did not meet the criteria for ADHD.Perhaps I'm skeptical I have worked with kids many kids who had other conditions that were misdiagnosed often by pediatricians with ADHD.I see you.Wow.rightHopefully the person that they have an appointment with is good at diagnosing this stuff or is able.Right.All right, whatever.That's a very good point.I'm sure there could be conditions that could look like ADHD that are better ruled out by developmental pediatrician then by mental health

yeah.Thanks.Nope.Yeah.Thank you.Hey, what's going on?It sounds like you're feeling more Angry.Maybe we should talk more about that.Do you feel she could do that for you?I realize I was thinking about this last week or maybe a few weeks ago that you haven't mentioned very much about her family your family just the impact and maybe it has just not been a focus of yours, but I was struck by that because I imagine it had to impact certainly her family but your family too.You didn't tell me that either.That's quite an incident.You had said that you didn't tell them about her going to the bathroom.I said that you didn't tell me that either you said trust was you said trust.What was it?You said about the trust I said, sorry, let me repeat that.You had said that you didn't tell them about her going to the bathroom.I said that you didn't tell me that either you said trust.What was it?You said about the trust I was struck by that.We were meeting just us, but it was still not the because I've only met with you and Tanya three times.So it was just I guess the context wasn't as clear but it was just us.So I'm feeling like with the more trust.You can share more.Is it for Lee how I will talk to you about about it or feeling more trusting how we'll handle it together.And how might it go wrong?So you said mitigated not alleviated?Yes, and you've been underwhelmed by how some people are doing their jobs.That's good to hear.I can sympathize a little bit but the part about Tanya and this emotional affair being less likely to discuss that with your parents or whoever seems like a different category than Tanya's illness and the extent to which she was suicidal, but somehow you see that a similar.Maybe I'm not sure.As is abuse a lot of things the devil is in the details.It's interested because I was thinking that when you share something that you really need help with your actually assuming that the person would be able to deal with it better than you right.I'm not saying you feel about way but that's sort of the reason about talking about this with someone.It's too much for you.You're helping though actually help you deal with it.You're not sure of certain details like Tanya taking the plastic bag into the bathroom.You're thinking that you can handle it somewhat that somehow no one else could it would be too much?Someone who is helping you would need to I'm not even talking simply about me.But anyone you would rely on to help you through this.I was thinking about this before with your siblings.You are kind of bringing a logical formula.There are this many people and I can only have this many conversations usually people are closer to one sibling or two siblings than others.That's who you talk to you about things that you need help with or that you share.There is a way in which you go into this very logical or there's a way you go into this.Dirty logical formula about time management.It's almost like kind of information management or an information flow management.Like that's how you think about it rather than I'm so overwhelmed.You can't believe this just happened.This is just catastrophic.I don't know what to do.Write will a piece of its managing yourself and sort of figuring out how you could organize yourself to deal with it another piece of it.What was the word that went through my mind?I can't think of the word something about taking care of it or how are you going to sort of sort of you being in charge of this feeling defacto and charge I have to say families are different and so forth, but I think God especially at your ages and I know it's complicated given who you are and given Tanya's family dysfunction given her father's abusive marriage and so forth, but it would be much more likely to be the parents and not the spouse.Especially for people in their twenties would be managing this like all of it.I was sort of speaking to a norm.There's not going to be a right about the norm.I guess it makes me think about I don't know if you are Tanya said this you were born 40 something about the way you guys manage.It makes me think about keeping more in their 30s or especially 40s where your parents are older and you basically don't want to always bother them.Yes, that's probably more than speaking about Norms or whatever which may actually be irrelevant on some level.I think that's maybe the point.The footnote it's not really a footnote and no one else what often seems to be attached to that like the volleyball team.What were you just thinking about?Because what seems best is never for you that someone else handle it.Because it seemed best then you wouldn't always be in charge.Which is itself interesting.I think the fact that you guys are married makes it a little bit less convincing statement, but when people in their twenties gets get sick.They often go home and get treatment where their parents are.It's a logistical Dimension that also has a meeting and itself.That's not at all uncommon you're working on that.It's a little bit more nebulous in your 20s, but it's still pretty common certainly with a lot of different people under stressful circumstances.I was thinking that it's not like you guys have to stay here because you both have jobs here and you can't leave.I guess we're going to need to stop in a moment.There's certainly more for us to talk about I guess in a sense what we're talking about.What I'm communicating is I'm challenging some of the assumptions about how is just logistically made sense that was in.The logistics there is a lot of meaning behind that in terms of the amount of responsibility have for Tanya.I guess that's what I was thinking about and the way you started today about feeling more of the anger especially as the X in exigency of the circumstance is subsiding.I don't want to get lost either.I have definitely noted that and I think that is important for us to continue talking about 2.Okay, I will see you next week.Okay.Take care.Hi, how are you today?I just had to run for something quick.Sorry about that.Oh good.Are you like a den.Or something or you just going?Yes.What are you going to do with all your free time?You want to go down and I guess your concern is making you more anxious.Could you tell her that that that's more of an issue than your depression?I don't know.It seems to me sort of characteristic that the actual story is a perfect perfectly reasonable story, but you're thinking you'd better tell her a different story because somehow that seems more like it could get you what you want.Even though the actual story is like I said, not only pretty reasonable but would serve you just as well.Good.What's that?Less than or more.Good.I mean not the discombobulated part, butand it sounds like it has something to do with having all this stuff to do I guess my impression is that most of it isn't stuff that and itself is hard or worrisome in terms of what it involves more like things have kind of got to go right?You're not going to have a lot of time to be worried or be down or be distracted.So maybe you're kind of worried of what will happen if you're feeling one of those ways.Oh, really?You mean if it hasn't been returned in 10 days, it's good.Not yet.Does this feel like just something else you just had to do this morning?It's $50, I think.Just after my pilates class.Where is it?Can't take too many trips to the Firehouse.He is a busy fellow.soccer and hockey and Cub ScoutsrightIn what ways does he pressure?bouncing around not listeningup on the couch.You know there could be any number of reasons.I don't think that it's that he's not around you enough not to know your buns.He would learn those pretty fast.I don't know.I'm very much speculating here, but it sounds like Jesse's sort of on him a fair amount and worried about him a lot and he could be kind of pushing back.That's why I'm careful to say that I don't really know but he just doesn't do the same thing with you.There could be some of that on his side to where he feels a little meteor for her in a way, you know, Mom comforting stuff like that.He kind of gives her a hard time because of that which sometimes kids doMaybe it's to compete more was Lucille if it's around her sure.No, it's probably not that I mean, I don't know how much you ignore him, but it's not something kids get used to.He sounds like a very energetic vigorous curious active kid.That's great.I mean it's especially tough for the people who have to look after him all the time.I mean, those are very nice qualities.I'm not saying it's not the easiest one for you, but it's pretty nice.They play with them more and they have to play up to their brothers.how to respond to that oneYou mean she might get cranky?Is that what she does?Wow.It's hard being the daddy.How often do you see her?once or twice a weekYou're going to need to feed him I think.We should stop for now.I'll see you on Tuesday next week, but I'm out on Friday.No, you did that often.Hi, come on in.How are you doing?Yeah.Usually the way I work with people is I like you for you to start with whatever's on your mind and then we can kind of take it from there.short transitionAnd you're not alone somehow.That seems like quite new information.Because you were saying last week, you don't think your dad has ever gotten treatment because that's kind of who he is.People confuse not expressing one's the stress is laid back.Some people are just very expressive that doesn't necessarily mean that other people are anxious.I would think also that you might function better and structured environment.That wouldn't be where your anxiety would show itself.That's when you find yourself.Where in the mostkind of like you were a when you're alone with your own thoughts.Are there other things that you learn from your dad and your brother?You were talking last week around about your body and worrying about having a physical problem after the doctor's office was closing.Are you less focused on it today or this week or not?Really?It's something that's familiar to.becauselike what?Herbs can make you sick.It's not that I want to give you something else to be anxious about.Does it feel like it's contaminating you somehow?Was happening that bad coke me an experiment.Was that the first time you had a panic attack?It's unclear if it was chemical induced or not.But this wasn't true for you before that experience.You told me a little bit about what happened that day, but can you go into a little bit more detail about it?You sort of panicked having that experience.so you neverWhat feeling was that?So the Panic is about being poisoned.That sounds very very scary.How long have you done Coke for before that day?Were you drinking a lot before you started doing coke?What did it do for you?So at the time you started doing better, is that when you started drinking?Well, it's more important to you to fake it probably.I'm sorry.So you went from being quite disengaged to engaged.What made you interested in?It was someone just doing it and you figured you try it.It's hard to put the picture together in terms of your being more voting motivated in school and also doing drugs.People do take Coke to concentrate.as a recreationThat's don't frequent.Were you ever worried about where you feeling you were getting really addicted or over your head?What stop that eventually?Not eating but just binge eating.Was that what you were doing when you were overweight as a kid where you binge eating?like at nightWhen did your bin how old were you when you started been cheating?JamieJames snacksBecause he was thinner.Do you think your parents knew?So, where would you get this?So you really thought about this this was plant.And so would you you would binge eat at night.Would you eat a little extra or would you be benching?So that's more kind of social versus binge eating when you're alone.Do you know when you ate alone were you eating because you were lonely or were you sort of just looking forward to being on your own and eating?How would you feel after you ate?Like physically or did you feel guilty?What you're describing it's sort of changed over time, but this very close relationship with your emotions with what you take in your body.And then sort of how you manage your emotions and it sort of Morphin something different now, but there's still that link now, it's developed into an anxiety around it and anxiety around what you're taking into your body, even though it doesn't sound like it's an anxiety with food, but it sounds like that one experience.rightIt's not I mean that one experience with Coke, I'm not surprised that it's it's like a post-traumatic stress reaction.It's like someone goes to war and you hear shells and then you hear a car alarm go off and you getYou know and it sounds like you're having that experience with medicine or anything.That's you know, what you think of us for and in your body are potentially poison.It sounds like a traumatic reaction.Huh?So they're still it's helpful.We're going to need to stop.It's helpful to know that there's still that preoccupation with it.Okay.Well, I'll see you next week then.Oh great.Thank you.Exactly.Great.Thank you so much.Take care.I'll see you next week.Okay.Bye.Bye.And how are you doing today?That's unusual for you to panic at work.Yeah, that's different.So do you notice a difference already and being back on the Seroquel?Is it just Tuesday like yesterday Tuesday or a week ago Tuesday?Okay.That's pretty significant.The past few days what when you say suicidal, what does that really mean?How long have the thoughts been what level have the thoughts been?That's a really uncomfortable 5 minutes.It can feel like a really long time when you're feeling that sat.You felt disappointed clearly.And you miss them.That's what I was feeling.So there was no thought at that point.So that tightness is really uncomfortable.And doesn't go away at work or it didn't on that last Tuesday.Are you feeling not tightness now?It doesn't feel like you have any control over it, but it does go away.Let's give the Seroquel some more time to work.He's been on it for a week.It sounds like it's helping a little let's see what happen.How is things like I know it's been snowing.Have you been able to exercise at all?Because that's sometimes you know, when that's more available to you that can really help because the tightness is muscles, right?That's a muscle tightening that you're feeling.It's really uncomfortable.It's not dangerous, but it's really comfortable and not something that exercise can really help with.Well, it's not necessarily that is just something that helps in the moment.But when you're more active that can lower the bass line the way to discharge some of this energy that's right.Now being translated into anxiety and tension and all of the good Healthcare self-care things that you do like getting regular sleep exercising on a regular basis.They lower the bass line anxiety.So it's not something.Yes, it can help in the moment.If you're starting to feel really anxious and it's a time when you can get out and exercise it can add that destruction the phone in a moment, but if you're able to get engaged in a little bit of activity every day that helps all the time just to lower the overall anxiety the discharge some of that energy to get endorphins flowing that counteracts some of this other stuff you're feeling the exercise can be a mood lift and an anxiety prevention technique that works across X on something that's really hard for you to access so it's not working for you.It's been a rough winter.Yeah, it's definitely more challenging.It's been a rough winter for them.Or go someplace indoors like even just doing laps in a mall right you think about I know we talked last time about thinking creates a creatively about how to navigate some of the challenges people do still exercise in the winter and when not be in weather going to be driving someplace and doing laps in a mall or finding it's their path you get creative if you can find ways to overcome some of the challenges so that you don't have to put doing something good for yourself.walkingYou can walk laps around any indoor space.Yeah.That one's out of your control.We can find ways to try to make the best of it.But absolutely we can't control the weather.That is the way to escape in.What are the next few days look like?And you're going to go.What's going on with your mom?Wow.Well one way to do it is to think about I know a long way back.We thought about instead of thinking about doing that concentrated exercise just how to build a little more movement or activity and today so it sounds like you're going to be, you know, like parking at work parking at the doctor's office.Park a little bit further awayYeah, so choose a spot.That's the longest walk.And then it's just you know, so you get a couple of minutes.Maybe they're the same thing at the doctor's office.It's supposed to be warmer on Friday, you know a safe spot but a little bit further away don't pick the one that's closest to the door take the one that's safe, but farthest away from the door and give yourself an extra couple of nasty spot and that can build in, you know, just 10 minutes of walking during the day just by doing a couple of things like that and that's Amanda manager away, you know to be able to walk in places that probably have been plowed, you know, they're going to pop a parking lot.The parking garage is covered.And gives you just a few minutes of being a little bit more active maybe a little bit of fresh air here and there that's a way you can be more in control of what you're able to do.That sounds manageable.It's not forever, but it's what you can fit in these couple of days.So instead of seeing all the options that are close to you is option that you can take these couple of days.I know.Have you been doing that?What do you choose year, did you use elevator or the stairs here?So what about choosing the stairs on the way up to is that something you feel like you could do?What store is your apartment?So those are ways to look for a little bit more.Maybe on days when you're not carrying as heavy of a load.She was in the stairs up on the way to the stairs off as well as choosing the stairs down our little ways for you to take control of where you can get in just a little bit more movement in your day.I think one of the things that work when looking for is not how to make huge changes but places where you can feel less crap because I think that feeling that's hiding in your chest and that I want to escape sometimes that translates to like I should kill myself to stop this.Those are it seems to me that those all come from feeling like you don't have any choices and that you're trapped and you know, that can be from you know, all these snow storms feel like they're kind of trapping the small apartment feels like a strapping, you know, not knowing what your job options are going to be kind of news you feeling trapped financially.So the more places we can look for like well, what are what are little choices that you can make maybe you can't change the whole situation but there might be some changes you can make with in so it doesn't feel like so much like you're backed into a corner without any options whatsoever.Sounds like that's kind of what kind of happened with your birthday to you.Can't you don't have a space where you feel like you can invite everybody over for a party.So it felt like you had no option and was going to try to give you a suggestion.It didn't feel good.So if you got creative what could be a choice that you can make that doesn't feel like a choice having people over but is there something else you could do maybe to celebrate belatedly on another day?Would you like to invite somebody to a restaurant?That may be a way to acknowledge your birthday.And if you frame it, you know as like, you know, would you like to come have go out to the dinner together?So it doesn't imply that you're hosting a whole thing, but people can go out to dinner and each pay and that's a way for you to know that your birthday.I feel like I've lost touch with all my friends because I have who would you like to reach out to?It seems like it's important to connect again with them.That's true.Will it be time that you know, enjoy?Yeah, so it might feel good to get together with the group and might feel good to sing.Those are things that are all set up before you decided to rejoin.I mean if it seems like if you're up front with the leaders that you know, you got these commitments already, but you'd like to rejoin.Talk with them instead of shutting yourself out of something talk to them about it.I mean there are two things going on socially.When is that use you no feel sad to you that you haven't planned something to acknowledge your birthday.It's a very noticeable moment of having disconnected from your friend.So maybe that's not you know something that you involve the people in but you've also noticed that you've really disconnected from your friends and you've missed being part of a group and music piece fits that so maybe reaching out to fill up.Annie me about getting together for dinner and knowledge in your birthday that works on one piece and talking to the music people about whether it would make sense to start now and sort of piecemeal of what because of these other commitments this evening.If you can reconnect with that group and enjoyed getting back in touch with that part of yourself,What are you up to?What would be the worst case scenario?It's never happened in the past.Sometimes I think you're more resilient than you give yourself credit for.What if it helps?Well, if it hurts then you stopped this is not signing up for lifetime membership.If it turns out that it's harmful in some way than you stop if it's useful if you enjoy it.That's probably a good thing.If you reconnect with some people you enjoy those things tend to be good at treating depression, you know, getting involved with activities that are pleasurable that's good stuff and it might be that and if it feels like it's too much of a pressure right now you say, you know, I'm sorry.I realize it's too much of a time commitment right now and give yourself permission, please.Hopefully it won't come to that.But if that's the case, then you've learned something and sometimes people need to do that.But that might not be the case.It might be that it feels good to have something to go to an option.That's better than staying in a ball.Or that you know that it might be hard to leave the house sometimes but when you do it might be good you get over that hurdle.Yeah, I mean to be responsible for that for yourself.And how does the age become an issue?are they sort of upset by your ageIt sounds like the group is not worried about it.Certainly not at your age now.Yes, the rather than look for reasons why it might not be good now or might not be good in the future.I wonder what stops you from letting yourself kind of give it a try.Your job is for you to be in control and not let the anxiety and depression being control anxiety and depression impact you but you don't have to let it control you.So I know that it those are the things that are talking right now as you think about what could go wrong or why it might not work in your life.That's being zeidan depression talking you can listen to those things, but then you make a choice that's good for you.No, you can't.You got a lot of challenges right now.So let's just focus on one piece.Like you said it's hard to make all of the right decisions would sometimes feels harder to me.So let's take it just a couple of days at a time and focus on making one or two decisions that feel like their tourist house.So, it's Wednesday evening.And you said you had some you had some plans.You're going to go to your mom's after the doctor on Friday.What decisions do I make between now and when I see you on Monday, let's focus on just one decision that feels like it's towards house.Okay, so then you set it up so that you can do that and that sort of the one step towards reaching back out to people may be getting engaged with something that would be positive.Does that feel doable or is that too big of a decision?Well, it could be either let's go with if it turns out to be a bad decision.This is a decision that could be undone.Right?So when you're thinking about killing yourself to escape, that's one that can't be undone by joining music can pretty easily right.That's a smaller decision than moving out of your apartment.So it's a pretty safe one to take a gamble on.I think you're afraid.I'm afraid that it's going to be work rather than enjoyable.So, let's see what it is and if it's works then you back off.How's the tightness now?Yeah, I saw that shaky breath, which I think is maybe part of what happened.Your chest gets really tight.Well, I'm glad to hear that.See if you can take some really deep breaths.Let the oxygen do its work.Remember that the tightness is not dangerous.That's the first piece right is that is uncomfortable.That's not dangerous.I think remembering that is the first step and you might not be able to make it go away but it will go away eventually.You can try taking some deep breast.Sometimes that house.I know in the past sometimes when you try that, it feels uncomfortable to focus on the breath.So if you know, you give it a try and take some deep breaths and if that opens up your chest, you know and just like I did and just like I just did I sat back I put my shoulders back that allows you to open up your chest a little bit that can help a lot of times slowing down your breath can work to relax you a little bit like your muscles relax, if you can't get it to go away remember that it's going to go away eventually it has never lasted forever.It's always gone away eventually and sometimes just knowing that it's going to end and it's uncomfortable as it is.It's not harmful to you.You're safe.Can keeping those thoughts in mind can speed up the process of it going away because it's anxious worried about that.Keep you tight and anxious and worried some good describe distraction techniques.Sometimes hopping into a warm shower if you can, you know, if your home and you can do that, you can try it.If you have heating pad you try putting a heating pad on your chest to relax the area.Sometimes just a sensation of warmth or pressure can help to distract you from the other Sensations that you're feeling like you can really only feel one thing at a time either pressure or temperature.The nerve endings are the same.So sometimes if you kind of confuse your body by giving it a new temperature is there's not really notice.The pressure is much.So can this be a way I mean, you can feel both at the same time, but if you can wait it sort of distracts youSo you can try some of those things but it will go away those things might hasten the process, but it's always going to go away.Yeah, that's true.That's I know I know that's really uncomfortable.So it's the only thing that will make youIf you try those other things and it doesn't go away and you're at a place where you can't stand and you want sleep is a much better option than Jet and it's even a better option than worrying about it.I know that you've always told me that when you have those thoughts that you're not thinking about actually falling through and then rather than engaging in that cycle of thought for 5 minutes, if it's not night time take a nap that's better than it's better than engaging in a cycle of destructive thoughts and maybe it will be better when you wake up or maybe one of those other techniques can work and you can get some control over it and I would try this first.Okay, so when it becomes available, you can try it out or have a shower or you can run some hot water over a towel put a towel in a plastic bag and lay back over your chest and it will be warm for a little bit.And you can see if the worm is soothing or run some really hot water into water bottle and do the old fashioned hot water bottle and just give yourself that warms for a little bit and see if it opens up.Those are little things you can try.Why don't we stop there for today?And I will see you Monday at our regular time.Sir, speaking of favorite color.I have green blue purple or red.Okay.Thank you.So I'm clear you have no insurance, but you don't have any information yet.When you get it, you'll give it to me and I will give it a whirl billing it and we'll see how that goes.Oh, really?This is the Kinko's.A lot of times they just let people if they make you go get something they just say come back up to the front not today.What's on your mind?like emotionallyall aroundI know you mentioned it, but we hardly talked about it.Can you tell me a little bit more about what happens?And how long do you usually live there?When are you first in bed?Okay, and then do you usually get up at 2 or 3 or do you eventually, no orAnd then do you sleep through until someone in the morning sometime in the morning?and then you get up atyou're sleeping about 5 hours or so with two or three interruptions in an ongoing way.I assume you've got some good drugs for this but clearly not good enough.It's you talking for sleep.Be reset often times when people have an ongoing sleep difficulty like that if they get one night or a couple nights of decent sleep and then makes it easier after that.Is that happened with you?Okay, so if you took Benadryl for a couple of nights, took it early plan to go in late to that over the weekend.There would be no difference on the next night.Okay, and how long has it been like this?You've been getting 5 hours a night with two to three interruptions for years.Okay, so if you could go to sleep every night at 2 or 3 and wake up at 10 or 11, which I know you can't realize but to understand that would be better.Who prescribes for you?What had he prescribed?Right, right.This is a psychiatrist, right?Which is pretty aggressive about the sleep stuff.Did she try other things besides Ambien and trazodone?Right, which has the same stuff is?She did nothing.Have you ever tried?I guess I'm thinking it might be good to get you a new prescriber.Yeah, okay.Look I don't mean to derail us and actually talking about what's going on.Nor am I convinced that this will solve your sleep problems or that my guy giving you antidepressants right now is even possible but I think some of the stuff might help we should probably get the ball rolling on that think of a lot of things one if you email me do you want to use your insurance for it?Okay, if you email me the list of people in your insurance were in the area.I can look through it and see if there's someone I know unless you think you might know somebody already it will probably meet a bunch of calls.Okay.Alright we can stop with that for now.It just seems like that's a good ball to get moving.You probably tried about a million things for sleep.So I'm not going to try and suggest anything for sleep because you probably already tried it a few times and doesn't work.You tried a whole lot of things if you actually hadn't tried anything, I would take his point but their doctors that are prescribed you three different medications and made a huge but you've tried all of them and it hasn't helped at all.It does not necessarily mean the answers on some block on the internet.You're feeling extremely sympathetic with him.I'm sure at that point.About what?I see I don't question it.But I take your point.It's your view that you're kind of doing it too much to him.I don't know how to evaluate that in a sense because on the one hand.I know you're having a very hard time and there's been stuff at work.You're sleeping 5 hours a night.Maybe we haven't talked much about that because I don't remember some of that or maybe it was a while ago and I forgot.Who knows anyway, whatever.The point is clearly you're having a very shity time.It certainly makes sense to me that you can lead one to dump more on their spouse.Another hand you could you get so angry at yourself for dumping anything on anybody.I could kind of see it going on.Whatever I take your point that it's putting a strain on the relationship.You could you could do that.What is a take?Yep, you're utterly overwhelmed.And at your wit's end.And how suicidal?NAPA Parts goodBut close enough to be thinking about it.What's that?Tell me about how you're really sick of it.What did they do?That's it.No shrink.11 year old to shrink when they eat a bunch of cigarettes crazy.I mean crazy if your parents you are a super depressed 11 year old pretty unusual for that age to do something like that.I mean 15, okay 11 not so much.I've seen certainly girls who want to jump out a window or something the kids just don't usually try stuff.Yeah, or Sahara said the Arabian Nights.Is that right?You'll still have the option.What's amazing is you're having a really really hard time?You might be right about that, but I'm not sure on one hand.Clearly.There's some of the stuff that we don't talk about that much and maybe we should more and I don't know.How much is that?I just haven't blown haven't known about the ongoing way in which some of these things are just completely awful is not come across so loud and clear to me as day last spring when you were in school.There was a time when it was really bad there have been some times when you started working where I don't think of it as bad, but I guess they didn't seem to me that they had been this bad again.I don't know if it's if that's just sort of my not knowing about it or if you're feeling like things are going that way now and Something's Happened the question is which is it.Okay.There was the time I think it was last spring when you were pretty close to taking some pills, right?There was another time since we had been meeting where you would open the cabinet.Was it before we went?rightI'm confused because I thought you had fired her because of how she was about some of the stuff you were talking about.That's certainly not useful or a string style to diagnose anybody that you haven't met with.Yeah, it certainly wasn't relevant at that moment.Okay, let me be very clear when I'm going to say I'm not blaming you.I'm waving my arms saying that I'm not blaming you but I can but I think it can be hard sometimes but I'm glad you're doing it now for you to say how awful our dire things are.And what all is contributing to that.I think there are.Hard for you, and that's why I'm asking.I'm not blaming you.Also.I'm glad you're letting me know.Now.You already told me last week things were worse.You don't hide things exactly.I think so.I think you're worried about talking about it with some people when they don't it feels more aggressive.Like they're kind of angrily keeping things back.I think you're more frightened.I could be wrong, but you probably feel pretty ashamed about it and worried that it's going to make you look like assholes and if whoever isn't really going to want much more to do with you, is that about right?I see.I know there's a lot that we haven't touched on about how things are awful a lot to do with how sleeping affects you work, which is what we were talking about last time.I think and some of the suicidal thinking I know I've asked a lot of questions.I guess I sort of felt like I want to get the lay of the land a little bit and worry about missing other things.Are there other things at the moment that we are missing.Are there other things that are feeling as bad as well.When is the trip with your family?I thought it was March or may it's me.What's on your mind at the moment?I don't find you a particular or particularly difficult to understand.We should stop.No, no, it's okay.Go ahead.This is another can of worms, but I have three things quickly.When is do you want to talk more about the trip?I know you haven't been hot about whether to go or not.Maybe it's worth thinking about a little more.I don't want to put something out that stress on you if it's going to feel stressful to think about we will wait a while second.I wonder if it would be helpful to have another time here.I would have to check.I'm pretty whacked at the moment, but I would do what I could to do that if that might help I don't want to start a promise or dangle.I just don't know if I have that I will look.Well, that's in third.I hope I mumbled something about this when you first brought it up, but certainly if you have been suicidal and scared you can call me I get calls.I don't want to say all the time, but certainly sometimes like that have i mumbled something about that before.Okay, good enough.All right.Hello.So we started couples counseling last week, but we're still feeling out.Dr. Janice to figure out if he's the right person or not.Well clearly it was deeply upsetting.It could be that it could also be that she doesn't want to further burden you.Did it make you feel discouraged?You do.Well ultimately for you to feel I don't know if okay is the right word.I'll use OK more than just okay, but is one of two options and I'm talking about not tomorrow, but sort of ultimately that you feel like your vows to her are the thing that's most important to you because that's who you are.And you do love her and you'll see what needs in this marriage can be met and the needs you can't get mad at you in some way and find satisfaction in your life the best you can or not the best you can but in other areas and sort of acknowledge the limitations of your marriage or you decide to leave her and even though you're extremely important as the she you want a better life with somebody else with more potential and LS angst-ridden existence that just builds resentment.And those are one of the two options that will ultimately make you happier.To put it in a nutshell.What are you thinking?No, neither is ideal and both have unpleasant and disappointing aspects to them for sure.Write the former is a more internal process.The path is more internal and the ladder is internal but more external as well my saying that comes from feeling that that's true.Also, wets framing it is that you're not trapped.You have a choice you have choices.The third option is to go on the way you're going on and I'm not suggesting that you should ultimately that you should choose tomorrow pick up.The sort of in the long run is to feel angry and trapped and maybe over time is that.That's an option.It would be an unfortunate one for you.Right exactly.I see right, right.Got it.And how do you feel about that?I mean you're saying yes you agree, but then what are the feelings attached?I've had a couple of other thoughts in one is and we talked about this before all of your experiences disillusionment in your life and how just deeply disturbing that is and has been for you the other thought I had that maybe as part of I could see you why what I said could be comforting for several reasons, but that you know you so hope for ideal situations and so many ways that idea that things could be good.Even if they're not ideal.I think it's a very nice for you to feel that would be very very nice.What what I said?Well, I guess how do you define recommendation?It was a descriptive statement that implicitly it was prescriptive.It was certainly descriptive.And I think when I think of prescriptive I think of this is what you should do, but I think it would be more accurate my saying this is what I want for you because I think this would be good which is a little bit different.I'm not sure.I understand what you're saying, but I'm not sure what you're referring to.Yes, seeing equating non-ideal descriptions with situations that are bad is exactly the problem of trying to address.I want to decouple that Association.Hey.Yeah, and it shows up in so many areas of your life.You talked about it with respect to your career and how the option seems bad because there were some I don't want to say fundamental flaws but flies.Yeah, well as in problem and that they were not ideal.Yes.Oh, I don't want to get rid of the category not okay.I certainly hope I didn't mean to imply that at all.Right, and I think I was more commenting that and listening to you.Not ideal is off an equivalent was not okay or not.Come sing a broader range.Well, ideally you would have married the person that you thought you married and she wouldn't be suicidal and she would embrace the same values that you have and that's ideal.That's not going to happen.So within that what are the possibilities for you, that's the so I guess the equivalent of if nobody's going to use chemical weapons then what can you do with in those options people feel trapped when they feel that none of their options are okay, then you're trapped.So the question is how can we make the options available to you?Okay, and then in that you actually probably could see more good at each of them then if a parent right now.You know, I'd like to know more about what you're thinking, but I'm going to need to wait 2 weeks to I didn't mean to disturb your referee.Okay, so I will see you in two weeks.Good luck next week at your conference.I'm sure it will all right.Sure.Tell me what's new.How about that?I bet that was helpful good for you.I see you applied for.About how many is that?That sounds like fun.Yeah, this morning sounds pretty different from how it often goes.rightWhich seriously is sort of the same movie again, isn't it?Like well, what I've got to do is instead of deciding preemptively that I failed at this so I don't have to sit around being anxious about whether it failed or not.I'm going to sit around and be anxious.In other words.The move is to kind of admit defeat in order to get out of an actual situation.You kind of Stave it off or Ward it off again.Do you know what I mean?I see.I've never read that.because of the crucifixionOkay.I would imagine that implications of it pissed you off.Oh, really?Maybe you're a little anxious to be mad and critical.What do you mean by its meaning something in other words?I guess one of the things that occurs to me is one sort of meeting which is often the way we talk about it is more.Like how does it work when you feel bad does it do this?What does that do in a way that seems like one kind of meeting but then there's something else which is ratified by anything Redemptive about what's going on.We're just talking about how it works.There's also meaning something which I think is often true in this context that there's something Redemptive in the suffering.I'm not sure which one you're referring to which sort of meaning it lacks or maybe both.I agree that for you.That's often true.I don't mean to make a larger point about suffering but one more local to you, which is yeah, I think mostly what I hear is depression and anxiety had making more isolated and when you're suffering the most you're suffering along usuallyI think part of what that is for you which may not address the kind of broader issue, but it's for you for the moment forgetting who's responsible for this you rarely been able to share your suffering with people around with him, you mightYeah, I think this is the part of the kind of background noise or background radiation.Where is like, when am I going to get sick and tired of frustrated with caring about how bad it is?I think it's kind of an indication or an illustration of how much you feel like you can really suffer.You had better be by yourself because nobody really wants to hear it or at least not for very long.so if you're suffering and means you're going to be by yourselfwhich again is probably some broader existential question but I'm not intendingclearlyWell, actually my suspicion is that you're sort of in the Middle Ground there.When I first heard you say it was like I bet that's more than you might have shared some time in the past to say that you're having a bad day and given more or less overview.But there probably is a lot more you could say that doesn't occur to you because again, you kind of don't want to go there.I'm not suggesting that I think you should go there.But what I'm interested in is that it doesn't even occur to you that there's more to the story such as you always get down and feel like you haven't been a good enough job, which is how you feel when you haven't gotten a job, which is part of why you're feeling so bad.You're probably also thinking about suicide in a way that's a release.There's any way it feels crummy and you're probably worried about staying in this really downward Jag after having felt better for a while and that sucks.there may be other things too I just know these are things that you often I have often thought and again I'm not saying you want to be telling your sister but it doesn't matter to you that there's more to the story secondYou're in a difficult situation where it's hard to be in touch with yourself and hurt at the same time.I don't know.Maybe she was more in touch with you that way or has been consistent in responding.icingI see it feels a little like smite.IC contagiouswe should finish up.Good morning.It's out in.I see.One thing that accursed me is your feeling relatively well good.I guess like yesterday the other day and stay and it's like you don't need me in the same way if you're feeling good.I think that's a little more for you.Not then for everybody but more than for most people.I guess part of it is that it's not just that it's different I think but that less now but still to some extent without realizing it you lose touch with what it's really like the other way.I follow like the people in the conversation yesterday on Facebook or sort of making these comments and judgments very much within their own worldview without necessarily realizing how much they are in their own worldview.There is kind of another side.You mean?Sometimes it is true because I do think there are times that it can be helpful to have one formal given diagnosis or informally something about depending on what the Dynamics are having the sense of part of what you're finding with me is that there are with the people hide behind that or use it to move away from what their experience actually is another words what I mean is depression is not very descriptive compared to something like paranoid schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder those things seem more descriptive than things like depression or generalized anxiety.Yes, where is I do think that something like paranoid schizophrenia or disorder are a little more useful.I think it doesn't say a lot about who the person is.Absolutely particularly bipolar one, it looks pretty biological in the sense that for some people bipolar is affected a lot by what is going on in their environment for other people.It just isn't and for those people it's really good to know.Like if she were getting treated and thinking more of herself in those terms stuff like that.might notAnother thing it seems to be where we're at with some of this in a way.I'm quite sure what to make of or what to do with how to think about when you're feeling more this way the way you are today.Well not in my mind because it's feeling better per se but I guess for reasons that at least to me so far are not entirely clear maybe because you're feeling kind of strong I think.When you're this way at least me it doesn't seem like your kind of has possessed by the things that you feel or perhaps.You don't know what those things are.You're talking about how it might be really nice to me, but I'm not really sure why it's not that I don't believe you but I don't know what you really have in mind about the changes.I guess you mentioned that it might be easier to get a job, but I don't expect that's all what you meant.You said it would be better for James.Although again.I'm not sure why and I can certainly see how if it would be better for him.It would also be better for you seem somehow.It's a little less clear to me so far.Are you thinking that it seems a little less self-reflective or more bland or something?To me, it seems like you don't need as much help hearing those things or maybe any by contrast.I guess I can also see you in a way how you were feeling like being well if I'm thinking about how to tell people about this is because I want to spread it out into the world or but these bad things out there in the world.Do you know what I mean?More something like you're looking for some help with how bad you feel.We should stop for now.How did things work out?I've got your message, obviously after.Sure.Yeah.Yeah, I wonder what you're picturing when you say I need more help.What looks what would help.It's a lot on you.Yeah.What if the dilemmas is that you articulate what you wish you had that would that would help for as a parent who is more supportive both of you you wish that only for your own parents to be people who they are not but his parrot sounds like that also is a piece of what we may have thought clear after your exchange with Ivan's dad that he has tremendous deficits also as a parent.So he was hysterical on the phone.Yeah, I'm not.Did he call Ivan or did Ivan's mom call Ivan?No one called him.Yeah.Well, I think that could be one of the things that for you right now is most anxiety-provoking about not only finding the note but then to discover in the whole system of your life your shared life with Ivan that neither of you has a set of parents or even a single parent who you can turn to for some guidance and support through all this and that's devastating.Yeah, one of the things that's hard.I mean, dr. Farah said that she does experience a dynamic in the room get so polarized.We are holding this kind of rage and criticizing criticism and he's holding all the shame and kind of recoiling.I think that the thing I would be pushing you guys to start getting out there and understanding together is that I don't think you're the only one which region criticism in the room and I don't think he's the only one with shame in the room and me anxiety.I think you carry around tremendous Shame about your own family your own experiences.The problem is that you just both deal with it in opposite ways.He puts his head in the sand and you kind of do a very opposite obsessional organizing cleaning organizing cleaning organizing cleaning.So you take it almost as a critical attack and he takes it with the withdrawal the problem is that right now as long as you're in that place is going to stay in this place, you know, and if the couple's work is going to help you it's going to be able to help you come back to not feeling is responsible for him not feeling sort of letting go of your criticize them criticism for the for the time being and him to start to grab some more of his own self criticism going to put his own agency initiative.I think one of the problems in what's getting clear in this family system though, is that you both haveSet the parents who kind of rainforest these ways of being in the world and a find the Ivans dad.For example, here's what his son wrote a suicide letter and doesn't want to doesn't want Call Him a Cowboy that he is.That's how much he sticks his own head in the sand.You know, that's extraordinary.Told you not to confront him about it.And this is how much things got pushed under the rug in this family and still to this day.He can't be a responsible appropriate parent around and appropriate parent would have been to call him and say I need to let you know.I know this I'm so concerned about you.What can we as parents do to help you with this and that's absent so it's all the more infuriating for you.The problem is what if that's what you're going to get.What if that's who they are.And you have all this feeling that bubbles up about how he could do that from your own childhood.You've done that your whole life.Okay.Okay.So one of the things we have to I think get clear about in reality is his parents are not going to be parents to him in the way you want them to be.That may be an option is to try it.But who knows?I don't know her, you know her better than I do for sure.I don't know what kind of response she'll have.That might be then the next step is something you could try if you're being practical but if she responds in a similar way, it's that question than what if there are not going to be parents.We're going to help them either side will your parents?What would happen if you called him?But what so what's missing he would ever response in the moment.That was empathetic.It sounds like he would say, I'm sorry, but he wouldn't be able to be to offer more of something.Is that what you're looking for?Like somebody who's going toBecause nobody's going to be able to fix this situation.So if you're not ready to get separated one of the things I think we really need to help you do more is to learn for right now to not be as responsible for him.Cuz as your language comes out Ramona every single thing you're saying is that it's as though he's your parent and you're saying I have to take care of him and I have to be kind then I have to coax him out of that.Then I have to do this you sound like you need more protection right now from playing that role and anything and everything we can do to help you not play that role anymore.It doesn't mean being extremely angry, but it just might mean saying stepping out of the of scenarios in which you feel drawn into take care of him.Just not doing that.What do you mean when you say it's impossible?When you say that, what's happening is he not getting to work?So that's what you need to not do anymore.Well, that's your responsibility though.That's not his responsibility.That's more symptom.Okay, but that's not your responsibility.What are you afraid of?So you don't believe he'll get to work if you don't get his schedule.Actually, I know a lot of people who call at the last minute get their schedule and function just fine.Yes, I'm not saying that's ideal.I'm totally with you on the way you're doing.It is more appropriate.But this is the kind of thing you we need to help you even for one month.Not you're taking on being his mother.But you don't let him try so we don't see what will happen.If you don't do that.Do you know what I mean?Yeah, see you sound like you're at your wits and Ramona.If you're saying you can't not let some of these things go for a month.Do you know what I mean?But this is that important for example, what if you were two separate I don't mean to force.I don't mean we're in a separation.I just mean the living you went and lived with your sister for a month or something like that or he went and got his own apartment for a month.Why?When I say that, I'm not suggesting that that might be the exact scenario.I don't think you're hearing me that you're asking me for something that can't happen in reality then.Do you know what I mean?I hear you wanting something that's not going to exist for you.So we have to work within the limits of what is possible in reality and figure out which option is best for you to hear what I'm saying?Are you sure I hear how bad it is Ramona?I did a lot of talking to doctor Pharaoh from your eyes so that she understands.It sounds like she doesn't quite understand how bad it is and I try to tell her these these kinds of things you tell her all of this.Yeah.So maybe one of the things would be helpful is for me to talk to her again to clarify a little bit more.Even you're adding these bullet points of things that are happening to make sure that she hears that loudly and clearly about just what continues to be going on things like this out that's minor in the grand scheme of things.Like that would be the kind of thing.I'd say to you see if you canGo buy another shampoo for a dollar find a cheaper shampoo.You can buy it hide it so he doesn't use that one and use that one yourself the car.That's a different story The fridges a different story the things that start to up the level of impact in your daily life has mood swings.This is where I also think like even you're not going to separate separate spaces right now how to develop some space for you.Even if you're going to be living in the same space how to say you won't then spend the evening together, you know what I mean?So what do you want to happen?Then?What are you hoping someone will tell you to do.What is more help look like?What kind of help do you need?To do what?It's not stupid, Ramona.Of course you did.It sounds like you need someone in your life understanding what you're going through and how real and how horrible and how scary this is.Just even finding a suicide note.Ramona is terribly terribly scary and overwhelming.I don't know if it felt like that didn't get honored in the couple session.You sound and I think one of the things that might help is identifying what you're feeling is right.Now.The thing that comes out most is anger.Like even at me today, you're a psychic told me is anger you sound.So underneath that Ramona terrified.actually remote at your struggling toit does to me.Listen, it does to me it does matter.It does matter.What is in a couple session you said I'm terrified.I am absolutely terrified.I'm not talking about wrong with his behavior.Do you hear the words that I'm saying are I'm terrified.That's his problem.How about you don't take care of him you keep saying I need to take care of him.I need to.Not your problem.I actually think you'd have more likely to have a marriage that would get saved.If you could say it's not my problem more because he will also have more likely of a marriage he's going to save the more he can say it's my problem.I got to do this.I got to miss.He has a very serious personality disorder.On top of depression.He's depressed to what it sounds like you're responding to are the layers of the way she regulates affect and respond interpersonally that can be manipulative can be moving to extremes without being able to look at things in a more mature way.This is stuff in his personality that is in addition to being very depressed.So I think that's also part of what it feels of.What is so frustrating right now.Is that a piece of what's getting at attributed to depression actually has to do with being depressed and having a personality disorder at the same time.I think so.Which is not schizophrenic is a very different is very different.Then he would be two different people.That's totally different diagnosis.He's not schizophrenic.I don't thinkYeah, yeah.It's really hard that you're going through.I don't know for sure.I don't know him.I don't know what's going on with his treatment would I do know from talking to both?Dr. Faro Dr. Board, but they both feel he's made quite a lot of progress.So independently doctor board said he's opening up in a way.He never did in the beginning he finds more of his own feelings about actually being angry in that set in the session being upset rather than just kind of whipping himself shame.That is a that is a symptom that kind of covers up a whole lot of other stuff.Dr. Farrow said she also felt like he was really beginning to find a little bit more of a boy's she thought the two of you guys were making a lot of Headway for a while when you were being seen twice a week for a little bit until she went away on vacation and she said she felt like everything fell apart and almost felt like none of the progress that ever happened.She thought at that time was feeling quite hopeful about where the two of you were beginning to head together.So I'm saying that now because I think just to know that there's perspectives are that changes happening in him.It's not as fast maybe as you'd like it to happen, but character change personality change doesn't happen quickly.It takes years.So this is a new piece of the puzzle that doctor board didn't you didn't know even that Ivan had made threats, for example.Maybe you can understand and that it took you awhile to tell me because you were so embarrassed about it.Do you remember?You feel like you're getting blamed.So he's in good hands.So this is more piece of it takes time getting into a relationship with a therapist to begin to sort all this out sometimes years.So that's kind of what you're up against in reality is that I can't go a lot faster.Even if Ivan were to go into the hospital for example, say he were to feel so suicidal again that doctor board to me it what feels hopeful about this is whether you and Ivan stay together or not is Ivan is now doctor board knows he knows about the letter he knows from me because you both give me permission to talk to him a little bit more about these threats.He was making it's extremely helpful to him now that he knows this because it kind of flushes out a little bit more about what's going on beneath the surface.This means that Ivan can now start to talk about some of this stuff for the first time in his life and my guess is stuff.He's kept bottled up inside.She hasn't been put into words will start getting put into words.That's all good stuff.Doctor board is an excellent therapist.He's probably one of my top three therapist in the entire city who I would refer to.He's outstanding in his intuition about people.It can't get much faster, especially or example, what's your doctor board says?Okay, Ramona.Ramona wants you to get testing.I'm going to come in and tell you we need to get tested if he does that and the poorly-timed Way Ivins going to say what and never go back to see him again.So he's got to also pays himself.Even if he agrees with you.That's a really good idea and agrees with me even with psychopharm.these are things thatwhat I can do to keep my role as keep him informed of all the pieces that you can keep telling me to make sure he has a whole picture.I think that will help him and Ivan.It even sounds like he's giving me permission to do that.I think that will be helpful that Ivan.I don't think that's only in your best interest.I think that's in his best interest that people get the fullest picture faster.Projector boards also going to have to find a way of bringing this up in ways that are palatable and manageable for him too.And it might take some time to do that.So I might say to you if you can even until we meet next not bring anything up and I'm saying this not going to work.Your marriage is not going to work if that's what happens in the long run, but even just to get a break right now you're flooded with anxiety Ramona your float it flooded and you need a break from this you need you some Breathing Room the two of you need some breathing room.I need some too but you especiallyI'm in your corner.About kind of thinking about what you need.The brake is not going to come from a parent right now saying let me come and visit even I wish maybe in my heart of hearts.Do I wish I could come just descended your life.Of course, I can't do that.So how else do we build in kind of quiet internal parent to give the both of you a little bit of breathing room and all of this as you start to sort it all out.I will also talk to dr. Farrow & Hammer home even more than I already that I did already what you're saying to me today because I think it's more of a perspective that she's not thinking of as much.I also would encourage you to go in and don't hold back.Say what you said to me today to her to Ivan what you're feeling about the work and the feeling that maybe you can't get any of this if you feel like you're not being understood or being hard in the work and that's a piece of what she's asked what she's asking you what do you need?What do you need?What do you need?One of the things you're arriving at is I need to feel like people really get what's happening and I don't quite feel like all of your attending what's happening through my eyes.That's a piece of what is that's a piece of what has to happen in the couple's work for you to feel like it has value to you.Say that the next time you're there, but also know that I will have called both of them in the interim and left a little bit more information to make sure they're getting the whole picture of all of this if you continue to feel like Dr. Feroz, not getting it like if you feel like it's biased and you've had a chance to talk about that then it's not working for you.That's important to and what kind of cross that bridge when we come to it, but I think there's a little bit more that can get communicated both from you.And from me before you're at that place.In the meantime, you need a break right now.I would watch movies.I would cook dinner.I would try to keep it light-hearted for a little bit and know that you're getting to keep coming back here and talking about it.He's going to be a very big turning point in his own therapy right now.Is there pee now that this is out there?It opens new doors into places that have never been looked at and if you can get back into the couple's work in a way that feel safe and good for you.I think that could be helpful to bring the things you talked about at home.Bring it here.Try not to have those discussions at home.If you need to see her more often than see her more often.Does that sound like a temporary plan?And he's at work.Okay.Do you have some time then apart in the evenings together?Any Overture of something that's kind of like a little white flag or peace offering to just get a week of peace.I'm not talking about permanent.I'm going to park it and kowtow to you and talk my needs in other just talking about let's can we take a Hiatus from the intensity of this and try to save some lightheartedness together?No matter where your relationship is headed you both could use the use that right now and I think anything that's kind of waving the Peace Flag for a little bit even if you'd say to him.Let's take a little break.I'm not going to bring anything up.He's got a job right now.You're going to pay the bills this month.He doesn't go to his job one day.That's a different story.Then we have something else to address, but if things can kind of remain kind of percolating along at the moment to take just a little bit of time right now to have some breathing room together, I thinkIs what you need so that the urgency can calm down some.I think it would be helpful to you to try to see what happens.Even if it's just to say I feel like I'm holding a lot.I'm very worried about him.I wanted to see if it would be possible for you to check in with him yourself.See how she responds I would not go into it with High Hopes in your own self protection.You might go into assuming she's going to respond in a way.That's not that productive, but you're putting it out there to try to protect yourself and it's worth a shot.I think that's totally reasonable to do.Okay, I'm out next week on vacation.I haven't said that for a little while, but you may remember me saying that a few weeks ago.Did Thursday work at all?Okay.I don't know if I had both times available Thursday morning in the email, but I mentioned 8:20 and 9:10.Yes, as of now I do.Is either one better?Okay and Thursday that works that's when you don't have and I'm out of the office all next week.I have you checked off my list that I told you.You're much bigger things on your mind.Where do we start today?How did you feel?So bored frustrated no panic when you feel stressed when you look back over the week and you say I still feel stressed.When are you noticing it?So it's not during the actual doing of the day.It's when you were.So it sounds like what's really making you feel anxious and moments are parts of the day is when you're kind of predicting the future thinking about having to get to work if I have enough time.Will I have time to get this project done?Will I be able to do this thing on my own in the evening?How does it usually turn out?That's good.Is that what you're worried about when you're worrying about not having enough time are those the things you're worried about?That seems like a long time ago.It might make you feel less anxious because it sounds like a lot of times anxiety stemming from not knowing if he's going to be able to follow through on a plan and feeling dependent upon him even though you don't need to be dependent upon him for that.It kind of sounds like you kind of feel like you are.It sounds like some of the anxiety is actually frustration when you say stress.It sounds like it's actually frustration maybe even anger.Okay, that feels like it fits better.You can't control him?or his choicesYou don't have total control over what happens?I know what your benefits are.What made these decisions.So those are the things that are stressing you out those things that aren't the way you would have them aren't really under your control because you're not going to take responsibility for cleaning his place.It sounds like it's not really a responsibility.What do you think?Are you unique in the desire of not wanting to lose your things?How much time are you spending at your place versus his?That will make a difference.So what is it?You think that you can do during those months when you're having when you're technically still at your place to alleviate some of the ways that you have about having enough time or being able to accomplish tasks?Is that what you're worried about packing because what you mentioned before is sort of having enough time in the evening or getting to work on time.better in the morningGreat.So doing experiments like that is really informative kind of figuring out what works for you and things that have been a big impact on your day 15 minutes in the morning making a much longer commute.You're not going to stick with that.So figuring out what impacts you and gives you the best benefit for the least amount of negative impact is something that sustainablethat sounds like too long of a commute though tothat's not going to work for you.No, but you need to eat to get through that.very important partsI wouldn't worry about it so much.So when your life requires you to get up early you need some caffeine in the morning.So when you think back you said there haven't been nights that you actually haven't had dinner.So you don't worry about not having dinner.So what's the worst case scenario for you?What are you really worried about when you're having to delay it?He doesn't like eating the kitchen when his roommates are there.Because he doesn't get along with them.It sounds pretty typical.Yeah, what matters is what works for you?And it sounds like it feels problematic for you to be limited in terms of when you can eat my other people he's got some difficulties eating with other people in the room.So figuring out what's the compromise for you guys then.I think trading off who gets their way might be a compromise you get your way this time.I get my way next time or not eating together.Or spending more time in your place.You're not spending time in your place because it's less comfortable.So it sounds like a lot of your stress is coming from this question of when is there going to be dinner?Where is there going to be dinner?But you don't know when it's going to be a problem, which is what stressing you out your matching that it could be a problem because it has been a problem.You don't know when because it's kind of a is kind of dependent on where his roommates are would you don't have control over?What's the discomfort with eating with the roommates?I guess I'm interested in both.Has there been expressed unhappiness with the amount of time you spend there?Has that always been the case for him that he's had that level of social anxiety.It's come along with the depression.It does sound like he's really avoiding being in the presence of others and he's kind of almost hiding in his room eating meals.You can do it because he doesn't feel uncomfortable eating in his room, but it does seem problematic that he's feeling the need to retreat so much and it's uncomfortable for you feeling like well when it's uncomfortable for you to kind of break this rule Pierce off of eating in the bedroom, but also because you're kind of being forced to hide as well.It doesn't feel good to hide in a place where you're really living.It sounds like to feel comfortable in a place you need to hold out.I wonder if having a conversation with his roommates might put you at ease to know what they're really thinking.Well, you could ask.Is there a way to make it more comfortable?If that was the case, you don't know if they're really pissed.But if they were is there something you could do to ease that?Who does the shopping for food at Sydney's place?So when you do the shopping, could you stop a few Necessities just of your own that your place that wouldn't be shared?So you wouldn't be able to have everything there.Yeah, it feels complicated.And it's very complicated and it feels so uncomfortable at his place.How aware is Sydney of the impact on you?Candy challenge himself to help you to be out there more with you.Yeah, sometimes it almost is reinforcing certainly the fear has its seed in there and then he doesn't do that thing until it started brand prices in his mind that he can't he probably feels a little bit of Anxiety Relief when he avoids the things that he's afraid of that he might actually feel better.If you could confront some of those fears and see that actually he is more capable than he believes himself to be.United Sara pist those are things that he needs to be working on with his therapist.Right, you can't control him or his choices or how far he can push himself but it does sound like in some ways you're being limited by his worries his fears.And then they're feeding to your own worries and fears.You want to separate yourself in some ways so that you can be independent of what's limiting.And right now it does sound like a lot of your worries are coming from not being able to control him but feeling controlled by his depression.I think it's I think it's important that you're not controlled by his depression.It does sound like it's getting really uncomfortable in your house, too.And there's no gluten-free Market in between here and work.Yeah, I can understand your frustration and it's challenging.Well, you have two months.Perhaps between now and then thinking about what it is that really needs to get done and setting reasonable goals in a timely way.It doesn't make sense to pack up everything now.There may be things you need but thinking about what needs to get done and what can get done.So maybe thinking about sections of your room and doing a chore and getting a section done by this time by the next time and setting that time frame of those eight or nine weeks.However, many weeks it is before.It will probably take more time.So that can just move the way it is.That sounds like a reasonable thing to think about and maybe setting aside time to do that dying.You probably care about that though.As long as it appeals to someone in your audience.Sometimes when you're packing up you have to erase some stuff.So is there a project you could do on a day that you're home this week?That would help you feel more organized or more prepared?Maybe that would make you feel better.That would be one project.You could get done reasonably quickly.It sounds like.Set one goal and that's the goal you check it off and you take a deep breath and you feel good about it.And then you said another girl the next time but you don't change the gauze you're working on it.You can't do everything at once, but you can set one go do it and let go of it.It doesn't sound like you don't feel like you can do much to change it.It's doing what you can to manage the anxieties that you have control over and it sounds like with the dinner situation.It's really about seeing if you can separate a little bit their control that the depression has on Sidney versus the control that his depression has on you and allowing yourself some independence from his depression.Maybe that's worth it on the nights that the option would be eating very late or eating in the room.It doesn't mean that you're making a decision about every night but making a decision on this night what works best for me if there is a night where you're able to do what works best for him.That's okay too, but not always feeling it has to be with working best for Sydney.Is there anything else that we should be catching up on our talking about today that we have it?it has to be a choice tohow did that feel?It's not a competition between you and Sydney.And that it's taking more effort for you.I can understand that it feels frustrating.Are you replacing something?Are you using the vegetables to replace something else or are they in addition to what you were eating before?And that's really the idea because you are a plate you are replacing something.That's probably better for you if you are calories.You'd have to look it up.They usually post that information somewhere on the website.So you can check that out get a sense.I'm not saying count count your calories because I would prefer that you be going by whether you feel full and do you feel like you're getting a good variety?Sometimes it is informative to get a sense of how many calories is in a donut.How many calories is in a coffee drink?Sometimes you might be way off base from what you're guessing.I'm not saying what to eat though, but sometimes get an idea so that you have a ballpark idea of what you have.Yeah, just to know your limits just to be armed with the information.So are there ways that you can snack sneak in maybe a little bit more activity into the day.It sounds like you've made some healthy changes with regard to what you're eating and the other way to burn calories is to find activity that you can sneak into your day.Those are good ideas.Yeah on a really hot day like today even walking outside for a bit.But you can also find ways in an air-conditioned building take the stairs things like that so that you don't feel like you're uncomfortable out in the heat, but you can still find ways to walk indoors where it might be air conditioned.It sounds like you're being more aware keep plugging away at it.And you don't need to weigh yourself very often you could weigh yourself once a month just being aware of the choice that you're making.You have your goal of one yarn box.for FridayI have us not meeting that week and then meeting the week after which is the 8th at 2:30.Okay, so we'll set another goal that day.1 Highme too.I'm not.Yeah, you're done.It stinks.well one thing that seems to bebut that seems to be true in the way you're describing Yvonne and Vanessa sort of talking to you.You'd also know you're talking about it is.It's a little more show than tell.You know, like what you've on you see it all over the place.Any sort of see it demonstrated how she talks?But it's not exactly what she's talkin.I don't know if it's what you talkin about or not.How so?I see.I guess something related to that.I like that.Vanessa is a spoon metaphor.I'm sorry Lucy spoon metaphor is the garbage disposal doesn't digest spoon to just mangle song.And there's kind of that feeling what you're describing like.Vanessa and you seem kind of mangled like they're not the stuff is just raped.And what they're saying is rapping you.It's not like this may be happening, but it's not the fact that you're describing that like their feeling to get is getting metabolized.Or you're helping them metabolize it it's just like you're getting all mingled.what what's happening to you andWell, it almost makes me think that maybe feels like something similar here, but you kind of say these things but it does feel like I'm really taking in or in some way helping you with how kind of overwhelming support of chewed up here feeling all this.Like you're saying it and it's spinning around and around more than it is like feeling as though kind of like it's going anywhere and I imagine part of how that works is.Probably let there's something it feels like I know you may be missing about what this feels like to you to be listening to them.amorth sounds gut-wrenching, you know, I meanAnd there's something very parallel.That seems like almost charistic of a way that it is disturbing.How old is Yvonne?He's kid like 5 or something.I mean to see a kid that age and that's for the vertebral out of control.With a mother who so passive and helpless.They're reacting.Yeah.I'm really not this Probably sounds weird, but my intent is not to be critical of her as mom so much as to say I imagine.It's terribly disturbing to watch.And more so because you both know it.Like she's not containing the kid at all.Right and that's expectable for like a two or three year old but not so much with a six-year-old.Does the mom or yeah, the mom does have a therapist.The therapist or something need to file.But that's not really.Yeah, and you probably feel like you go over there pretty much any hour and the kid is likely up.Sure.13B I mean a kid who's heard that 300 times before is probably about the number they're going to be going to have heard it most of the time like from a parent, you know, you can say that and they're like, okay, I mean, you know neither really worked out or something, but you can say it.rightrightYeah.Yeah, but you have something there that's incredibly wrong.Parenting and regular little kid looks different from what they're doing.I mean it's not obvious from this but I mean I am a child trained and until a few few years ago.I saw kids, you know and parenting it can be incredibly hard and hard to know how hard it can be to parent a difficult it but that's not what it looks like, you know, if they were sort of going for the rich fool trying to get the limits and you know, whatever X Out or something and all of that the kids are still going nuts.That's one thing as a kid was autistic and they like had some elaborate structure that the kid could not fit into but they're trying you know, that would be one thing or if the kid was incredibly anxious and just comes out of bed every 10 minutes because they're you know, what's right ofA ghost or something in there short of gentle, but firm that's different.This is not thatI mean it didn't sound like they had anything.And that yeah.Yeah.Yeah.rightI don't think so.Actually I think things to me that part of what's the serving for you about watching Yvonne with her kid is like you're mixed sort of feeling or mixed sense of judging her thinking about how she should be doing things differently or better.And you know in that way I think yourself feeling kind of hopeless about the situation.So I guess it seems to me that for you to feel more sure about how things there are fucked up and how she really should be responsible for her kid like she's being mean to her.Probably reassuring for you.And I don't hear that the way you're putting it amounts towards her like it doesn't sound to me like you're saying this was the intent to be critical of her purse a more like I mean you're critical of how she is with her kid, but you're protected with the kid.I mean this is I kind of feel likeI mean, this is tricky like so the thing I'm sort of trying to get my head around here is there's a sort of perfection parallel.We're on a smaller scale your sort of presenting to me how you feel unable to manage things with her?So that you can't become like Disturbed you're overwhelmed and unhappy in the way that you can't control by seeing her obviously with parallel is with you know her doing the same thing to you with the kid like in the instance your me.She's you and the kid is the kid.and also clearly you know, what's going on here is much smaller scale because she's an adult, you know, she's not your kid, butIt seems to me that both like yeah, I think you're probably right.There's a way in which year wanting me to kind of just validate but also like Tippin and encourage your rights her to protect yourself from them, you know, either by telling her that you don't want to see her or you don't want to see her without the babysitter or though you don't necessarily think our kids should be with the ex that you know, you don't feel like you'd be her friend.If you didn't tell her you thought you could handle her kid, you know.You shouldn't handle her kid, whatever some kind of limit.That would also help protect you butYeah.Yeah.We should stop.Thanks.Good morning.I do actually I know someone who is very good.And I also have a pretty big network of colleagues here who would he will know some people there?I know someone very good I've got but I've been in contact with him a couple years ago, but I can I bet you can you I can dig up his name.I thought he was very good when I spoke to him.It's fine.Good.I'd be happy to do so.when you say talk in that way, how do youSure.And so with Tanya that feels like moments of danger.But this isn't come they're not like intense moment of danger implying that.sitting with theI see.So modulating something or moderating.Seems like you're really a warrant on probation is interesting.I think she can't take care of herself in that way.Then maybe at times going there is okay, but not be able to not go there at times when there are other things you need to do, you know, or just sort of function in your day.You've got to wrap it up and move on.Did you share that with him?Can you tell me how that frustrated you?Well, let me make a running analogy which may not be helpful to you.So but I'll give it a try.So what so and I was thinking well, you can tell me if this feels like part of the point.Maybe it's a little bit besides the point but the focus of couples therapy is different from the focus of individual therapy for a lot of reasons, but specifically it relates to someone relationship.The focus of individual for couples therapy is not either weather either partner wants to be in a relationship.The goal is to make the relationship the best the relationship they can be whether one wants to be in a relationship or not is a separate issue a very important issue but not really the focus of couples therapy is kind of like a personal trainer answered and said, I'm not really sure what I want to get into this race or you know, butBut that's not the personal that's not that's that's a separate issue.You go to a personal trainer the personal trainer helps you get to that training for that race whether you actually want to take the stuff to do the race is a very important question, but it's not one you think you can talk about with a personal trainer.Does that make it's not a great analogy?It's actually a pretty good analogy, but that's sort of how I don't know if that address is some of the frustration that you're feeling.Ashley a really I think that out analogy, I think that is at least that analogy that conveys to you what you're feeling.Well, but it's the truth.And I have to believe the truth is helpful somehow.I'm serious.the soundsLike such a simple statement and perhaps in a way, I don't mean it at all.But ultimately you need to decide what you want.And if you want this and part of the problem with this is it's not clear.What its this is is this how Tanya was going to be this is a very bad stage in her life that she will move on from at some point.Those are unknowns.And so that decision needs to be made with those are nuns because those are unknown it certainly seems like there's this is going to go on for some time.it's certainly not clear to me whether this is just going to be a lifelong illness that will basically have this course or whether she'll get better could really go either way and a that you have to think about whether those situations are okay, and if you ultimately want thisWell, maybe another way of looking at it sounds like it's missing a piece but that's sort of how Tanya will fare in the future.If you take that variable out and say is that doesn't matter that much.I mean I is this the marriage that you would want to be in now and they're there enough things about Tanya that you love and value and are there enough parts of your moral system that you feel committed to that.This is the marriage that you want to be in.And so just try to sort of assess well things go better the future of this will be worth it verse not maybe it's not as important.It seems important in some ways, but then I thought about more and I thought I don't know because I'm even if I mean you can sort of makes your argument and safe.I'm 5 years from now Tanya is doing better will 10 years from now.She might not beso sort of tried to assess based off of your current investment could be very crude, you know later out come on a card investment.Maybe it's not a very good way to go.And if that's true that you will need to find a way to have that be more sustaining during these periods.Meaning, you know, your commitment to commit answer that being your kind of moral code and value system and sort of maintaining that adhering to that will help will need some sort of help you whether these more difficult.You know getting some satisfaction that you are hearing to that and other words.This shouldn't be the only reason not to leave but this it should be something that sustained you while you stayExperience is something that's confining and is limiting to your options.It's very different thing than something that you're practically committed chill and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.Well, I'll see you next week.Take care.Come on Inn.Morning.It's okay.when you say casually dismissive ofOh not even casually.takenwell, there's certainly that contract for some people make is very meaningful, but I'm less interested in some specific structure of it and the fact that the structure is important thatThe importance of having a structure but the particular kind of structure being wed to a particular kind of structure I think is problematic.Well, and I'm sharing with you how I think about things.And that I have reasons in so in some ways I have very clear ideas about how I think about things.It's not random.That it's not that I have that not only am I sharing it but that you're sort of your seeing that there are certain areas that I have been clear have very clear ideas about like something that I have thought about in developed.It's not random or like maybe this or maybe thatno, I want to know what you're thinking, but I think maybeI even if I'm thinking about why I even said that I about well, I think that you know knowing you that this is something you appreciate and there's sort of a lot of forethought into how someone goes about doing something.No, I don't think that way either but I was just the thought came to my mind was maybe this could be more generalized.But certainly, you know, when Tanya when she was sort of in and out of the hospital you were sort of meeting with people and you thought do they actually know what they're talking about.It was very scary and enraging at times do they actually know do they actually have an idea what they're talking about?Maybe more generally like this concern like do other people in charge know what they're doing.Well, and you're acutely aware that all organization organizations.I was going to say most but all organizations are far from perfect and not difference between how you feel.They ought to run and how they actually run.Is this appointing.I think sometimes you're not sure what to do with that disappointment like whether you should trust them at all then.wellHublot the disappointment slides into thatWell, that's sort of a promotion a blanket permission then that's the problem.Well, and you see that perfectionism in Tanya although it typically manifest and more in relation to herself.I mean she feels mostly we and then most dramatically when she feels falling short of being perfect, but the issue of perfectionism is definitely like I think you can relate to that just it's not sort of you don't hold yourself to the kind of virginity she does.Are you confused by my comments on Earth?How do you mean what what things are we doing differently?Then.There's certainly intentionally you're in putting the I'm I'm not feeling like I'm going into a particular direction directions consciously, butDisturbed what we were doing and talking about it like you ruined it somehow.Yeah, really interesting choice ofThey're the sort of Truth router sessions.There are sort of X in the session where it seems like your kind of attentive to your thought process and there are times where it seems like you're kind of acutely aware of sitting in front of you and dealing with that.That this moment.And I'm not sure what you know, it's certainly not one thing.Maybe it's to some extent unknowable, but it's still interesting what creates those shifts.like a pair of pussSo do you think that's continent or what was ashlea?Call Zenobia.interestingI think that's why people come to therapy and general sort of the fireworks.They have for processing that aren't working.There's too much new experience to incorporate and it's not fitting into the you know, the pre-existing constructs.It's not simply intellectual.It's emotional when is overwhelmed by information the information can be feelings and it's not just facts.But often is feelings are usually feelings and you know, maybe cognitive information.That's just overwhelming the system.I don't know how to answer that off the bat.What do you think?It sounds like you had some thoughts behind at in terms of just even constructing a the question as you did.yeah, I guess then my answer to that after hearing you're saying is that I don't think of facts and feelings as a sort of having separate structures, but their links their Associated so I mean there's facts stick out because there are feelings touchless facts and so by processing the fox you can also be processing the feelings because about thought of things aren't ruined has a feeling Association to it much more pleasant thanThe fax things are ruined.What's my name?I don't know how to answer that question.It's so broad.I would say that you're giving an example of one way you process feelings.You probably process feelings a lot of different ways.That's not the only way you process it.But that was an elegant example of one way of processing them.So when you say other people probability probably the way other people process that you process them toBut it would be hard for me to articulate that leavensworth comes to mind at the moment.I'm with mydo in terms of what do I think about?So this is not a question to invade that question, but I'm serious about this.Do you think about and other situations as well when you're with other people or is it just we tend to not beat we're not exactly.Interactive in a weigh-in at moments.It's in that makes what makes you here it is.In the way that it could be less likely in order another social situations for that to happen.Well, that's yeah, I have two different thoughts.My first thought is direct answer is I see what happens not just like what happened between us I see what happens in me where my mind goes I'm feeling and then tryAs it happens to reflect on what could be what that could be about but some I guess then doing two things.I'm both trying to tell something evolved inside me.And then also try to think about that at the same time.Sometimes I'm doing more than more of one than the other which is why in situations.I have a lot of things to say because I'm not thinking very much about what's going on.Sometimes I'm letting things.I don't know Ashley have any words for it.But so I don't have anything to say I just don't want to talk for the sake of talking.But so that that was one thought is a direct answer.But the other I had is we talked about it all along we talked about it today, but it's sometimes sort of similar to the foreground of just sort of acutely aware and sensitive you are about with the people.You're around your very end in on them.I do we're going to need to stop James but I do I do agree that this is sort of the sensitivity you have, you know, this is sort of acute sensitivity.This is to talk about and to think about together, but there's a lot there, but we do not need to stop for today.So I'll see you next week.Okay, great.Take care.How are you?What was it like for your Friday?Oh my goodness.This was a night you mean?the starting point of hearing the noises and then seeing them I would think that alone isBecause you don't know what's happening at that Quinn at all.How many are there had you been asleep?You went down to get your mom.They cut up.He's going to end up in somebody's yard or house.It's very very scary.I thought of you even with the police knocking on people's doors.I mean, I know they're there for a good reason and they're there to help and protect but just police alone have been have been a form of trauma.Even that though, it's not just that he could come to your house you're watching this happened.He could be right there.Not far, right?Before all this happened you would been in a space for a week or a week and a half where it was like coming down off of slow of tremendous energy about the two sites connecting you've been pushing and pushing and working and actually been productive and staying up late you had your hand and so many things moving for how could you keep that pace forever impossible?You got sick a little bit you got tired just letting your body be compressed.And then as you are decompression, you're aware that there's just a lot of other stuff their feelings about relationships were talking about Kelly and Bethany going back and forth and just feeling really confused.I think about what you're feeling and what happens the closer you get to somebody and makes you makes you then sort of look elsewhere.You think a lot of confusion as new things we're getting open.Apps for the first time and then this happens I could see in the state but this just added fuel to the fire being totally turned upside down and inside out for a while.Maybe a metaphor about being let out of prison and again The Coincidence of this event happening right now as you're really getting into this process.I think more opening talk about what happens when you you're really known to another person whether it's me, whether it's Kelly as a relationship grows deeper and you're actually being your whole self and not just editing and picking and choosing what to say and who to be she's being her whole self.But this event in a way it is filling you with a massive amount of hair again, that's something else in a way, but that's what's there's working right now.This is going to be terrifying I will get hurt if I get close to her the way I think you have been in the past in your childhood.Will you hurt her right?Are you the terrorists are you going to get terrified?There's so much of your life because of your relationship with your mother.That is given you those two options either you get hurt or you hurt someone else and if that's the choice hurting someone else is in some way preferable to getting hurt but it's like there's nothing else in the middle of those two.I also get the feeling that there's a lot of feeling, you know, you say sometimes you hit these moments where you're watching something and there's a feeling comes out like a release amount and then you feel better.It has that feeling to me that there's something jammed up inside.Even just from what you went through Friday.Good.12 * it's feeling kind of being cared for.And yet you also feel something when you're thinking about the good outweighing the bad.But has an ethic and meaning to Beyond life is meaningless, and we could all die tomorrow.but your dadFriday to bring up your father.Workwise it makes sense in relationship.I think it feels more confusing.What kind of threat lost conflict.And then what happened?You feel good coming in, though.You feel so sad to me.It isn't even an appearance thing.It just feels like there's just a weight of the world on your shoulders right now with this whatever.This is is stirring around your father like the whole family history of genocide and Trauma and torture.There's a lot in this Brian.It's hard enough just to be trying to remember in here in this process and kind of your pace getting yourself through a real thing actually just happened in a real-time and this is like other things.It's not all nevermind you and brings you back to feelings of these other experiences, but other another one you're experiencing right now, like all the feelings after your father's death that led you to cut yourself off and being meter lost in the world.To the world out to Oregon just aimless and Associated I can imagine that hopefully on a smaller scale and hopefully caught that kind of what we're here to do and help you but I can imagine that being a piece of what's happening right now.You have enough work under your belt and that there's this other life that you have going on that feels like it's yours in your attending to it.But how could this not be triggering for you for of some of the pretty dramatic feelings about to mention where you were right before this happened in the process?I think what I say, of course in no wonder as part of just trying to say the part of you thinking that really gets anxious about where you are today.And what would be weird if you were there today given your history.You can go back to Doctor Carlton.I don't think this is something that we should medicate.This is what you would do.If something like this happened, it's starting to happen after Monday and you come out of this probably actually sooner than you think.Totally I share you that's what you're saying.These are the things I keep trying to tell myself.It's part of what you're doing.Even being interested in what your experiences of this instead of judging it.You're surrounded by judges as a kid so many judgements from your mother and from your mother's whole side of the family these these things are either good bad.Good bad good bad not just interested in your experience.I think that's why so often you moved to wanting to judge yourself.Like this is bad that this is happening to me and then you say but the good thing is that I'm doing this.It's like things have to be judged as good or bad and there's something kind of comforting and familiar familiar and knowing whether it gets to go on it in the good column or if it gets to go in the bad, I just think that what's your family did but it's not about knowing who you are.It's not about knowing it's about categorizing and black and white kind of thinking.What are you thinking?To where?You're trying to gather it into the all of your trauma.meaning writing or not getting people togetherI think waiting for the next bad thing to happen is trauma.This is a symptom of being traumatized.There's this hyper Village Inns is it happens many different for it takes many different forms expectation that something really bad is going to happen and just waiting for its in some way adopted way of being if you're used to really bad things and keep happening to you if you're at least prepared for them and that's what it's meant for in any way.But again, why would you not be waiting for that right now and why also for example would not freeze you up from reading a regular underarm life andThat's also what happen when you were twenty if horrible horrible things happen your whole system starts to responding as if you were there for survival and waiting for the next blow.It's not about that.It's not about then forward-thinking and productivity and planning and being a proactive person reactivity.It's what's important when you're in trauma for safety, I could see also this feeling as you look down on yourself that you're notDoing it.That's what happens when your brain is preoccupied with staying safe and your brain became very pretty occupied with staying safe as you became really Psycho-Pass Matic after your father's death all of the fears about not me.I'm not having I'm having a hard now me.I'm now having a heart attack.I'm getting am I getting cancer as a form of hyper Villages waiting for the thing that's going to go wrong in your own body.I think you have a rationality to in your relationship with your mother before your father's death.She looks at a picture and says, oh she's beautiful and then oh, but she has a big mouse.It's like there's there's a bad thing coming from the relationship.There's a dagger that you could be waiting for with Kelly or else we waiting to go out to Talia.That's feels better.And I'm here.I'm am I going to hurt you or are you going to hurt me?As you've gone closer to people you've gone to hurt one another or another in your early life.That makes perfect sense when you love that much.You got hurt.That's very very sad tomorrow.Hi, how are you?How is going your week?I bought that one.When you say appropriate, how do you mean?How is that related to being challenging or is it separate?I see.Amazon hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this.I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child's right?I guess.Those are the only two that I would say more about that or just that it would be acknowledged or what would happen.Yeah.You're doing just fine on your own.Really you thought about it?I will say what the question about whether I was I just sort of pause after you ask the question how I been pregnant before and it wasn't it made me think that I didn't really like that question and not my in my not liking but the reason that I began to be more focused on you is that my liking or not liking a question should not be the reason that I respond to it.So it wasn't that I was I mean, maybe it seemed like I was becoming defensive.I don't feel like, you know defensive per seI felt like I think I'm losing the point here.It came to a question where I didn't like the question to make me think maybe I need to be everything just answering your question because I think I'm losing something in that so that's why I shifted not necessarily that I was trying to avoid answering it per se.Just I mean, I'm it doesn't really bring up anything negative, but I didn't like it wasn't like other questions.You asked me.Not a question.I wanted to answer.So that's what I meant by it not like I didn't approve of it but it was yeah, it was something that I was the last sort of just okay.Let's just answer that too.And then when I thought about that, I thought well my liking doing something doesn't mean that is necessarily the most productive or you know, something like that biking is a little too strong but kind of something around that.Oh, where did you go?Which one?That's a good one.That's a good look very quirky.I mean, there's so much that you said today that you know, I would take up with you and sort of well, at least a couple things are coming to mind.The one thought I had is when you were describing just a lot of bee stings not all your questions, but a lot of your questions were about me making sure I was okay and we're like concerns about the challenges or difficulties that they have driven like a negative balance, you know, like knowing a lot of other pregnant woman and how difficult it is and like kind of a long butt pain and I was sort of struck by that.And you feel like somebody that I would want to do to.Does it make you feel left out in some way?That I'm not sure my other set of thoughts which I'm sure are related somehow is what you were saying earlier about thinking about in general perhaps my pregnancy bringing even more to the Forefront about wanting family or not wanting family or not even knowing if it's possible Tanya and clearly that's thinking about that.Will clearly have a lot of fears and fantasies about what this mean.What in terms of like I mean, there's I sort of understand like I have some awareness of why you be thinking about this about Tanya in particular but it seems like there's a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a family or having a family.So she's working as a nanny for three small children right now.So like it's the sense in which I know that she could do.Some of the tasks of it.I guess that was particularly anxieties that I have.I guess I'll just list them or try toSo that I really hate the word hormonal but you emotional and hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy can be very intense and particularly for someone like Sonia was already buried in some sense unstable, like right now she is relatively stable.She goes into zones of instability and we're small investors like had a disproportionate responses from her.I'm anxious about that time.Both pregnancy and postpartum.Another reason that she'll be able to she works as a nanny for hours a week.You don't take time off that's not to say that one can construct one's life.So that the children go the daycare or have a nanny the parents don't share the labor but it's always there.You don't walk away from it.Like she should or like she could always just quit her job right now.It's not okay to quit children.It's just not okay.That's exactly what her mother did to her.So there are some real similarities between her and her mother some of those are presumed genetic genetic and some of those presumably I believe like angry person raised his children and turns them into angry people and they raise children and then turn them into like the damage these to propagate regardless of the genetics of the situation also,Where do I like she's at?The fierce there one is that she will behave in a way that her mother did and one is that one is that she wants like damages that were inflicted on her on our children?Because there's a real sense that she feels and posted them on me.So I think that's a list of major concern.I can certainly see as much as you're happy for me that this has this is tough.This can be tough for me being pregnant to the extent that it you know, brings up this issue more even though it sounds like it's on your mind anyway.Indulging sound so trivial for lack of a better term.I'm not doing it to indulge you.That's certainly a non-trivial question.You're anxious about what you're asking or from me on a lot of different levels.Haha.Yeah, I think we should certainly continue to talk about because it's not just about me here.We do need to stop though, but I'll see you tomorrow.Okay, great.Okay.Take care.How are you?Well, I'm glad to hear that.But he thought you feel better.It sounds like you did really have a hard week.We had some bad sad things happen.I know you are upset about your friend leaving and that actually had to face this week.And you said he had a difficult talk with his mom and you got just got news from the doctor.So those are all pretty sad things respond toYou were sad.You are sad.Well for a short time is pretty appropriate.This all happened this week.So if you're you wallowed for 2 weeks and then I'd say well it's starting to look like depression because it's stuck around for so long but sticking around for most of the week is still considered within normal range for reacting to sad news and difficult things.So what happened in the appointment?What did you hear and learn?You're saying that they're not believing that what they will do what kind of allowed to drink again, but it's going to stay in March.Yeah, it sounds like it is.What's that like to get those?It's hard to have that gone.Taking her the leaving.You know what he wish things you dress with her.That's too bad.How did Josh feel about it?There are things that have happened at the same time.clear controller hasthat's awful lot to try to handle in one week.You had a lot thrown at you.It sounds like he's got some sort of perspective that you haven't had yet.Maybe it's different to be the patient versus one watching the patient your positions with regards to all this I think part of what's hard for you is you have a choice and he doesn't and sometimes it's harder to be the one with the responsibility of making a choice.You can choose whether or not you want to stay with him and watch this unfold figure out what it means for your life.He doesn't have the burden of making that face.You just have to cope with it which isn't a good place to be either but in some ways it's a little bit easier because there's no he has no choice but to cupis this like eventual transport transplant or is thatIs that more likely is that the risk factor for him?What is the foreseeable future is that 10 years 20 years a decade?What is that?surgeonyou want to have answers of what the future would hold?Okay, but you don't get to the same place at the same time.It sounds like you didn't anger him that you weren't exactly where he was and that your reaction was different.It's nice that you like what you do.It's not a bad thing.What sounds like you have extreme reactions?There's no need to apologize for your feelings.You have strong feelings.You get really pumped when there's something to get up for it and you get a good reaction and it sounds like you had a good talk and you get really sad when there's something that's just part of who you are and it's okay.It doesn't seem crazy from where I said, I wonder why it feels not okay for you to have these highs and lows.I'll run.So you felt like you could be the one to be responsible for knowing when the limit was like when it had been enough days of Halloween and now it's time to go out for that run that was feeling okay.My crazy heart conditions you didn't have that stuff to manage.She's doing what you did back when you felt like everything was really under your control.Yeah, I mean in a way it's like your innocence has been shattered.It sounds like one of the parts of what makes it hard is not just individually what you're facing but that up until all of this stuff existed in your world.You were able to believe this illusion that things were under your control because you hadn't yet come up against something that you couldn't.And I don't think that it's that you've actually lost an ability to control everything.I think it's that now there's stuff that's not controllable.What seems like having overcome something like you saying give you practice at kind of getting back up again being or selling it?I don't think it's the only way to learn that being resilient is definitely a piece of being an athlete.You're learning it.Yeah, you're very aware of all the cost.Yeah, you have a lot of responsibilities than and thenWell, it's validating for him.You found some solace in seeing other people.This is an experience that a lot of people can't empathize with because they hadn't had their world revolve around Sports and their fellow athletes in a way that he did and professional athletes do so be able to read stories of people who are experiencing what he's experienced and not being able to connect to the world and connect to people on the way that he always had relied upon.And he really does feel comfortable with them.He's finding a new way of kind of fit in.You can give yourself a little bit of time.You're not losing your friend because she moved but she's kind of going to be a part of your life in a different way.You can still be a great friend.She can still listen and understand the way she does she did when she was here.You need someone to go do stuff with somebody else to meet for a run or walk with your dogs orNo, no.Which is everyone's worried, right?We can't tell you about it.What's it like for you to know that he scared of that?Tara feels a little strong.Well, I could have died that we're could imply that he's worried for you.But accept a relationship for what it is.It would be nice for all of you for you for Josh for your dad.If there wasn't this looming question of what was help you like and he thinks that is pretty pretty terrifying.You never know what's going to happen for anyone but it would be nice to be able to live under the assumption that things are going to be easier than the assumption that you're under.Even if it's not a correct or something, it's nice to be able to think about.Yeah, and believing.For how long do you do that?Well meditation shirt certainly wouldn't hurt.You know, when we do the breathing exercise in the mindfulness.That's a type of meditation the same family and it does give you at least a brief moment of respite from your worries and sometimes, you know getting a little break from what it is what you need.It doesn't necessarily change a whole day of what you're feeling.It gives you a break from it for the regular practice of meditation, you know, a lot of people do get more standing benefit of decrease anxiety increase acceptance.Have you ever looked into going to a meditation center?And it doesn't have to be.It would be nice to have things to do together sort of an adventure to a park and bark.Which is God.Do you worry about having nothing to do?You go a little stir crazy.The main structure for the two of you to do and remind for yourself at even though he can't go out and go for a run or go for a hike or go for a ride with you.You can still do those things.It's important for you to do that.Darknessor even a really gentle practice.He could probably do just a more half a base to rather than Vinyasa Style.Ashley had a yoga teacher used to say this is not a competition.Yoga is not a competitive sport.And it's important to not that you not go to that.What about doing some experimentation and finding a class or Studio?That's the right fit you might want to go and try out some first before you have him come to make sure it's not going to be a class that has a sort of competitive nature.So I make sure it's not one.That's not too active.Maybe too far out there.kind of stretching him one step from where he is rather than jumping too far out and then it will feel like if it doesn't fit so just going to a gentle flow class might be a good fit with that a little bit of meditation thrown in at the end usuallySo you're worried about him?You just can't be there for his heart.He's lucky to have you.Yeah, and you're lucky to have him he's got you up and out of the house and running this morning, which is a great listener mode.To take care of each other.rightsad and kind of afraid to let you go.So you really have found he's found different ways.It sounds like to cope with it and you found different ways to cope with that as a couple because you need to find a way that you're both taken care of and it sounds like you're figuring that out.It sounds like they are.Are there other things we should catch up on because I do want to make time to do some relaxation.So I'm conscious of saving time for today.So let's do a good long breathing practice and some relaxation.Let's do copay before we get relaxed to break your eye looking for checks or money.That's all right.All right.So just to let yourself get comfortable and close your eyes.Let yourself settle into a rhythm of breathing that feels comfortable and relaxed and feels natural to you and you can continue to allow yourself to breathe and comfortable.How do you spell in the place of your breath as we go through the relaxation to start scan your body from the top of your head down through your torso all the way to your feet allowing yourself to noticed when your body feels like without judging just taking notice of where you feel relaxed.And why are you feel tense?Also take a moment to become aware of what's in your head acknowledge the thoughts that are there and then let them go without any judgment allowing yourself to be present in the moment.Perhaps noticing the sound of things around you just noticing them and then letting them pass on and then when you're ready for your next encounter as you inhale you squeeze your eyes tightly shut noticing how that brings more time your face, whenever you're ready to ask how you're going to let that go letting your eyes remain gently closed and repeating that as you inhale squeezed in your eyes tightly shut and then when you're ready to ask about letting that goYour eyes gently closed and I was seeing what it feels like to be relaxed when the next breath and you're going to squeeze your teeth together clenching your jaw noticing where that brings attention to your job and your face and as you ask a lot of shots drop and your teeth depart least like letting go of that time and Helen clenching your teeth at 7 and letting that go shopping your chin and letting your teeth, part on your next and how you're going to drop your chin forward toward your chest noticing that feels like on your neck and your throat and when you're ready to ask Allah your had to float out to rest down your spine and how about in your head forward actually, let it rise up on the next breath and you're going to drop your head to one side to your ears your shoulder know seeing what that feels like on your back then as you exhale let your head float out to a neutral position and how your head to the opposite shoulder exhaling letting it blowed up to the center noticing how your neck feels different and the next and how you shrug your shoulders towards your ears noticing where that brings attention to your Shores your neck or your upper back.What do you mean drop all the way down as you ask him and how shocking up exhale and released in him and you're going to bend your elbows bringing your hands toward your shoulders noticing what that feels like in your biceps.And then as you exhale, what does arms fall and relaxing all the way in hell been in the elbows?And then you ask not letting those arms go out of your shoulders and your arms and your next and how you're going to make tight best nursing wear that brings X into your forearms wrist and fingers exhale release the tension drain out of your fingertips and how squeezing those tight this XL released but it all go in Helen focused on tighten your abdomen wall squeezing your belly button toward your spine.And as you exhale let your stomach relax a full deep breath pain in your belly be soft and how you're going to squeeze your belly button for tightening your stomach again.And then as you exhale, let your belly be soft taking a full deep breath.when you next and how you're going to squeeze your knees together as tightly as you can nursing the tension in your inner thighs when you're ready to Exhale, let your legs relax your knees makeInhale squeezes needs together XL and releasing let your legs fall apart when the next breath and you're going to straighten your legs looking up off the floor notice for you feel tension in your body.And when you're ready to ask a lot of attention when your feet fall asleep or letting the floor do the work of zorbing the weight of your likes on the next.Anyhow, you're going to lift those beat up again noticing attention Crafts near hips and thighs and as you actually I'll release it and let your lights come down and heroin bust in your feet.But your toes comes off the floor back towards, you know, just where the Springs passion to your lower legs and your feet and when you're ready to inhale exhale and relax your legs and relax your feet, let your toes be in hell and flexes feet toes back towards you notice what it feels like and then releases you ask about reversing that movement you're going to inhale impress those toes down to the floor cleaning your feet down release letting your heels come down in your feet relax and healing Point those toes down for the 4XL and relax on your next in-house.Can your body becoming aware of the place?Does your tension has refused to leave or may have returned to you as you exhale think about relaxing that space letting the tension drain away for being that process?Stubborn places where attention has refused to leave allowed to leave waxing your body as you actually take a moment to notice again the thoughts that may have entered into your mind and let them go without any judgment for what you're going to have to repeat that process as many times as it feels useful knows he might you feel noticing what you noticed your head and then letting it go giving yourself a moment to be free after you relax.And let yourself count to a few more breast memorizing what it feels like to be as relaxed as you are.And when you feel ready let yourself carry that feeling back to you to the room taking it with you good job, and I will see you in two weeks or week and a half after Friday.At 3:30.Yeah, we're back to old-fashioned.Good morning.I don't think of it as a session to session but I think of it as what you framed what your are asking for cans consultation on this is part of the process.I may have come to visit before.Is it anxiety that there are particular scenarios you're worried about or is it just sort of really Amorphis?I guess me one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is increased anxiety and one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is tiredness and depression for a while.I didn't remember if I told you this but a while she hadn't had the thyroid nodes checked in months and finally did get them checked when she had hyperthyroid numbers, which is a result of essentially taking too much of her thyroid medication.She got that adjusted and has been a less anxious in the intervening time.But this is sort of a I can pick out a signal it's not clear if there is any meaning to the signal like there are so many things going on in our lives and that's not necessarily it's not even clear.There's a correlation if there were it would not be sufficient evidence for any more causative role, but it seems to me like one has a mood regulating gland keeping the dosage of replacement hormone for that glass table is probably a good idea when one already has difficulty regulating mood soDid you ask her?So that was Monday so you didn't find out that she wasn't taking it.That is if you really need butter.That policy.There are a couple questions that I have one is what are you worried about in sort of staying in the moment when you're not feeling upset about something like this.Is the dangerous part the important part?Well, I think this is the heart of the matter in your marriage is how free are you?How free are you maybe that's the end of the sentence and how much are you as you describe very pointedly held hostage.You certainly feel more free than you did maybe two months ago, but clearly not fully free because you don't feel you can express yourself when you feel angry because you're very worried about the implications in a very dire way.So are you saying nowhere to go?It's like you don't have a train of any thoughts or you don't know what to do about it ornow what?Yes.I think that's the part.I'm not sure that you specifically don't fully grasp.Maybe we don't know all of what's at stake.I mean, you're not the one to do something because you're feeling that is going to set you already fragile way around suicide alley over the edge that construction.Yeah.Okay.Well, it's logical that makes sense.But then there are also some students and that that sort of things need to be thought aboutI was thinking that there are a couple pieces in that one is that it's helpful to know why I'm not just commenting on the timeline of when you bring it up, but she really may have not think it impacts her mood of the way you feel a Mite and so that's a conversation.Do you know why she doesn't like it?Is it this pedantic?All these things seem like great openings conversations.Like if she does feel like you're being pedantic maybe there's information in that you're being pedantic taking that you are.I'm not you are in response to something in this Behavior.She's doing this actually listening that responds.So it's an enter fraction.You're not just an acting in a vacuum.That's an interesting kind of conversation.I mean, there is a lot of interesting you're saying these are the reasons not to have a conversation and I'm saying those are actually interesting departures for a conversation.What were you just thinking?stewardshipYeah, I thought on that obviously whatever you want to do you do the issue at hand is that you felt for so long that you had to bracket your needs for the sake of Tonya and innocence about a conflict that your needs if they don't maybe not to say undermine her needs.At least undermine your ability to be present for her.So there's a conflict on that level.This is may be more direct that maybe you need to be expressive at the moment actually undermines what you think her need is to stay alive.Her need is whether it undermines it or not.If the question it goes to the heart of I mean, you may not think that it's much to give up by waiting a day or so.It may not that may not be a big issue for you, but it sort of guessed the heart of how much do you need to bracket your needs or hold yourself back and strain yourself or confine yourself for the sake of poignant.What were you thinking?And it's a fine line.It's on a Continuum.They're not discrete categories being considerate of others needs sometimes means bracketing your needs of it.Then sort of extrapolate out, you know in and being especially considered of being desperate.You know, there's no there is not distinct category.That's a Continuum which makes it more complicated.It's like on one level you're not wanting to express yourself In the Heat of the Moment for fear of hurting Tanya.It also sounds reasonable enough, but there is more complexity to it than that cuz that always have to be the cage.I'm clear that when we've talked about this before I put in a very direct manner Tanya Tennessee to abdicate her responsibility and your tendency to fill in all of the spaces a responsibility whether it's your responsibility or not, even your entitlement or not to do so does not fit well.I mean in some ways it fits very well, but in others.Where is perfectly accepted doesn't help either of you?And so when you say how is it that we've gotten to this point that I'm telling her to take her medication.When you're speaking to Tanya as you might kind of might tell A demented grandmother, did you take your medication today?I'm not saying you said it in that boy's butt that becomes a structure.But you broadened it when you started to think about as the extent to which you do that and this in a very particular context in your marriage and also in terms of what's going on for Tanya, but then you're sort of expanding into thinking about how this plays out in other relationships for you.Yeah.Where do you think they went?Denver is a pretty big city.There are that many cities in the country bigger than this.In general if you count the Metro.So that's actually not hard.I'm sure there are more concentration of jobs in those larger cities.But still there are not that many cities that are larger.Comeback meaning that they were there, but they are buried.Pretend like a big difference that they're there, but they're buried versus if they were never there because someone sends you then have to create something and other since you have to find out where they might be.This is sort of a strange matter for but it's sort of like the difference between giving a piece of paper and a pen or you going to shovel like a paper and pen is creating something that isn't there and a shovel is going to dig around to see where they went.to me, they seem like different processes, butI don't know.Maybe that doesn't feel right.Maybe theyNo not know.We're going to stop today.See you next week.Take care of but why?Hi, come on in.Do you it's from the furniture store?Good.Thank you.How do you link it to coming here in feeling more detached?You're going in the other direction.How's your picking?And you were talking about it.I guess it's small piece, but certainly a piece of it is knowing that having lost her inheritance and retirement yourself through your family's loss in a vast amount of money.On a practical level which has deep emotional implications and feelings may be angry at your dad for not taking someone's advice for feeling angry at life for being so unjust.You want to feel like he's tripping it even trying to take care of you.Ming-Ming, sorryyou don't want the dogAre you worried about sort of his physical limitations now what it will look like in the future.Do you feel like that?His limitations are going to get worse.Is that an edible with arthritis?Is the Detachment itself cause you distress?I guess there are a couple explanation for that one explanation is your in touch with being angry so you don't want physical contact?So what do you think of that?You're here to feel more in touch with your emotions that's having the opposite effect.Is that I said, I don't think that's entirely true.I think that I've seen you be more in touch here, but what do you think that's about?When you start feeling the intensity, what is that like?the associated with feeling sad overwhelmedWhat did you do?What did you think or feel when you heard that?Not memory about going to Virginia to the doctor in your mom taking your hand and you not wanting it is that in that memory Ru is it sort of an angry refusal or is it just like I'm not interested.An aversion like almost a disgust.I disgust response.Don't touch me like crouching.What about it?Do you think was a verse of Tia?RadissonBecause you're afraid that they would have the same response as you.Do you think we could try to get into that memory more?Yeah, I'm just wondering if there's a way we can kind of get into it more to see what you imagine.It felt like a version of such a measure of thoughts.Would you start at Midway?What would happen if you let him touch you?Did it feel like an invasion of your space or did it?You're feeling sex in your belly.Revealing anything anywhere except for your belly.Is it a pressure or pain?Are there any worse than what you're feeling or what you're feeling.Does anything come to mind about what you're scared about?Did you go there all at once or was it a gradual process?Going back.Was it like a switch?I'm serious.I don't know.What are the reason I ask is because I'm just really trying to kind of focus in and be very kind of attempted all this have had you had that feeling before in your belly or stomach.It seems like I have you had that feeling before is it usually associated with crying?I know this is kind of an odd question.But what do you think is in there?Gradual or not, you know this about yourself.I couldn't tell you if you said Express or suppress.Express that is what I was guessing.What did you think about anger?That made it easier?Right.That's the Adaptive part of you.The downside is that you're feeling those things could draw you closer to him.Or maybe I say that because that should be a question if you're afraid those feelings would actually push you away at least the anger part.The sadness.I don't know.I'm just wondering, you know on one level.It makes sense.If you really allowed yourself to have those feelings you would feel close to him, but it feels like that's not the all of how it feels to you.Maybe those feelings.I don't know drive a wedge or making intolerable.There's something it makes you feel helpless.Is it the same feeling as your father wanted to put his arm around you?I got this image of you.Just wanting to push something away.What did it feel like when she started telling you?Did you feel scared for her or scared for you?Do you think that's why your mother left?So, you know, you've named all these really traumatic things that your mother experience is quite a list.Do you feel that if she got in touch with those that she would be just too overwhelmed at what life has given her to force her to deal with and she simply say this is just too much.This is a really bizarre analogy, but I was thinking about a muscle that gets under you said that it gets atrophies and then get so brittle it can break versus a muscle that keeps getting using fortified and strength and overtime.And I was thinking that muscle being like exercising one's emotional.I don't know exactly emotional emotions or something like that.But that if it's if they're so underused it's like that's where the fragility comes from in a way.Do you worry that you don't have the strength to deal with all the feelings that you have?Maybe you got there a little today.I was thinking sometimes it's good to know the road you took to get to it.And if the goal is to get to a place maybe doesn't matter which road you took it does and it doesn't my guess.We're going to need to stop for today.Okay?I will see you next week.Okay.girlfriendOkay.Oh, sorry.Okay, so I will see you in 2 weeks then.Okay, great.Take care.Hey.It sounds horrible.askingrytex Community ClinicDo you want concrete suggestions as far as finding Puryear low-cost mental health?I know that's not until me a small part of this.studentYou must be really worried.First let the record show that I'm offering a concrete and I know if it were around here and I didn't know the area.What I would do would be tried calling Psychiatry tree Department.I want a more hospital possibly even a New York see if you can get ahold of the psych ER and ask if there are any good Community clinics are other low-cost mental health clinic those will sometimes you're by so I can still work for your treatment to people who didn't have much right here.I'm not sure how it is.Now.There are clients.I know in Brighton in Manchester Community Clinic or even if some of the hospitals like probably MGH at Manchester Hospital mental, you can pretty much just walking.I mean, I don't necessarily mean walk in and get an immediate treatment for walk in and get treatment sometimes pretty good treatment for my Chinese which is what he'd be getting I guess where you but as you say.And hopefully well supervised and sometimes the people supervising a running that's going to really very good and sometimes not but I'm guessing that expands Oral Roberts you thought with it along somewhere I want but yeah if you called outBest Buy, Christiana Hospital in the area they could probably just tell you that was offered there as well as what else you could go to because I probably referral they have to make a robot.Yeah, I don't know anybody who practices out there who I know firsthand, but if you get stacked, let me know.I can probably find somebody who does.Well Manning interest tax one in which will be good for practical point of view because she just dealt with this rather than means he'll pass it.But in other ways, I think it's imagine her passivity and flopping maybe even promises really pushes a button for you.I wonder if you're also feel that way here at times with me about the things that you bring out you then have to deal with them.It feels like largely on your own.I'm not saying it's the same as with your mother, but I'm wondering if there's no ask to it that feels similar.Or she could be proactive.I mean I get what you mean that you can't call him up and it probably wouldn't help her to let him know she's been speaking with you but in terms of being supportive of you and also in terms of I don't know trying to find him treatment or help him financially.We out which is one problem in and of itself and another problem as much as that leaves everything on you.I wonder if is also frustrating for you because of the part that it pushes up for you and that you think you're overwhelmed a lot and often have stuff that up and away and figure out what you're going to do.Anyway, in a way that feels like you got bootstrap or you got to figure out how you're going to handle something even when it would be pretty easy just to shut down or look away from it, and she doesn't seem to do that.She crumbles Wilkes.We're going to love it more.Yeah, and then their friends it's a backstop.I guess she is in and you have to be here for him and yourself.I think if you got your emotional about it would be hard to what was it done what you need to do.Yeah, I know.I'm not trying to make an argument that you should I'm just saying it seems like that's the worry.Yeah, it does doesn't sound like you had a whole lot of back of anywhere.Well good, I would rather that not be true.What?Will you do have help?Rose for yourself and for him directlyGood.I guess another thing you could do and probably need insurance for this but bday treatment for a few weeks.Yeah, you go like right here.It's usually 9 to 3 and it's mostly group base and it's mostly skills.So it's a lot of CBT and DBT.Do you know what those are?Not they're pretty structured and problem-focused very focused on charges for dealing with how you feel and things you need to function everything like that.Yeah, and it also would add some structure to your day.You make sure you're around people you can help you get hooked up with outpatient readers for awkward stuff like that or I'm going groups know when somebody's pretty stack or they're really having a hard time or have the people around them really quite worried which it sounds like he does.It could be our way.He could really reach once again, where is if he starts with a new outpatient therapist.He's going to probably once or twice a week.It takes a while to get to know them.And then you start with a prescriber.He might see every couple weeks or so in the beginning.Whereas this would be a lot more structure a lot more time and engagement a lot more immediate help which it sounds like you might need.I mean if he's really suicidal or something then he probably impatient, but I'm not hearing that from you.Then yeah, I think you're crying you to transfer that kind of a day program or an outpatient program.But once he's got insurance, you could probably start one and you were somebody else could call up a hospital or hospitals near him the offer thatwhat we should stop.Yeah.Hi.You certainly like that.Yeah.last nightYou know, I imagine you so much of you sort of like you you was afraid but this was going to seem like to her.There wasn't a whole lot of parent Lee.At least that we can know about at least that we can know about it.Sure.Yeah.I see.and even thatI felt the same.You must feel like this means you've been right.I think it's even more particular than that.That the point of keeping people out or away from what's going on, especially like bad things you feel I think I think has been because your anticipated that like that wouldn't give me give them a kind of that would give other people a kind of access to you.That would be very dangerous.That would sort of that they would react to in their own way or from their own frame of reference without taking yours into account in a way.That would be very hurtful to you.I mean, I don't think this is like what you're describing with James.Mom.Your mom and James are also different types of examples of bad, I think.That it might seem clear like that.Yeah, like your mom makes it about her.that's okay well they each sort of agendas that feels very destructive or hurtful to youwell it kind of struck me that there's really no room for both of you to be upset somehow in other words I mean I think this is a very sort of in part ofOf in part a construction on on yours or maybe both of yours.I don't know.For which, I mean like it seems to me as though it seems it feels like you can't be both angry and upset about it and scared and partly angry at him.Also recognizing that you know, there's some sort of as yet to be determined is not entirely his fault in the situation in that the situation has sort of changed, you know.And we're at least in your sense of it.He can't be upset that you know, you're mad at him andhe was trying to do something.He thought was helpful at least consciously andand that you're angry and disappointed anyway, and you know where he can feel that way but also kind of see where you're coming from.It sounds like it's way too kind of it's way too kind of jam together.Does that?Yeah, yeah, you have a sort of a split.Yes.In a way the irony is as far as I can tell like that's why we all have jobs is because of the difference.rightI see.Yeah, like you're just talking about it in the way.And let it goes till Easter.witchesthen you make your point.rightYes, I mean, it seems like you're sort of sandwich in between talking about it and conveyed.Well, I think you have to worry about conveying it one is sort of the word word.That's just come up.I mean in a way it seems like to me that's actually what James did more than you wanted, you know the level of detail, which he was describing.It felt more like he was conveying it in some way.clearly IOnly because it it lines up for me and sort of way that's unending kind of parallel to like, you know, the humanities versus the heart scientist.Like, you know today it's one thing and tomorrow it might be something else.I'm going to revise and update.Where is like, this is how it works.I know that's not.Sounds to me like like what you're describing is sort of the provisional aspect of what you are saying gets lost.And so it's kind of like you're held to whatever you said.or whatever that idea wasin some way that I guess leads to like it's both misunderstanding and a kind of shade.That's all right, if my what I was going to say what I was going to say that I think for you, there are two dangers in that one, which is what happened, which is that people use that according to their own agendas in ways that are very hurtful and the others that that becomes your agenda which really hurts somebody else.I mean, it doesn't seem like you seem to sort of feel a bit more anxious and upset and a little pressure.Even when you came in knowing that you were going to tell me about what just happened and I think in a way relieve that or less fear than you often are that what you were saying was going to either, you know, hurt me or that I was going to respond in a way that was kind of using it in some way to hurt you.I mean, you're still probably worried about those things.Oh good.You think you'll ask your mom about that?Yeah.Which means I think that that either he maybe was right.I mean because I too also wonder if you are.I don't entirely well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you've done something terribly wrong or you deserve sort of Mabry like really angry or punishing because you will allow yourself to be really taken care of.And to kind of like I don't know.I think you were still wanting to be taken care of in a way that you usually can't or don't and it could also and it could also both be true.yeah, I guess when you say that I think of what more of my concern is, like when he conveys that he's angry and it seems like part of the problem is you feel a part of you that of course, even though you should berightWe should stop now.Hello, Jay, Jessica.I want to hear whatever you're wanting to tell me and also I'd like to know about the homework, but before that a few days ago, we had a quickie emergency session, didn't we?I lasted about 30 minutes or so.I was not able to record it at the time.Would you mind sharing what happened how you felt what we did what you did and what happened afterwards?and then we can talk about your homework and everything sinceHe's a medical doctor.He's definitely not that's a significant point.Your friend the non doctor told you this.I think it would be good for you to identify what contributed to your feeling hysterical.Listen or listen and believe.Jessa I have a fantastic bridge I can tell you it's called the Brooklyn Bridge and I can sell it to you at a great price.Oh you want to buy it?Well done.I'm glad you're not a hundred percent gullible.When you're when you're making yourself desperate by telling yourself what?Do you do you tell yourself?I must find the answers.I must find the solution.the physical symptomsYes, but now I let us get back to look at your feelings of Hysteria on Friday night.Can you clarify?until nowWell, can you predict the future?No, wait, have we not already seen some changes for the better in your attitude to yourself?Right, you're human.Just her just to remind you.There have been times recently.I've been I've acknowledged your good effort and you thanked me but in the first week, we had a session you seem to to really not be able to let yourself taking positive feedback and then in later weeks you did.So I did I certainly have observed changes.There's evidence that your positive changes possible you and I have agreed that you're getting better at catching your shoulds.Your language is change your speaking in language that indicates you're taking responsibility for your emotion rather than blaming the circumstances.For example when you say I make myself hystericalSo there is progress now back to Friday night.Sure.Now what it was that allow you to change your desperation to Congress.tomorrowSo you were quite absurd.Think about it.Sounds like it to me reflect on what you just told me.In the past you have not found it at all easy to be assertive with your parents.And you just described to me that you are sort of with them moments ago without even indicating that it was a great achievement.In other words.It sounds like you were able to let yourself State the truth in an assertive way.oh, well, it isn't that interesting interesting notice notice yourself of valuation telling your father what you think and feel makeFrom what you told me I didn't I didn't hear any bitch like sentences or you leaving out a whole whole lot of verbal abuse that you showered on him.So notice how easily you can be hard and about in value 18 yourself and surprise surprise.I said the light on it right now so you can be more aware.So back to Friday night, so you made yourself Hysterical by taking too.Seriously what your friend and we agreed on Friday night that your friend has drama queen Tendencies and a doctor.He is not in a spike that we took his word seriously and you built them are out of all proportion it in your mind and cat has taught us both eyes and horrible eyes, and it was lucky when you called that and it was lucky when you called that I was available for that time for us to talk.And we were able to gather to put things in perspective.You were able to laugh you were able to make a practical practical plan and at least clarify that the Practical plan you considered already with efficient reminding yourself that tomorrow Tuesday.You were going to a doctor a real doctor so that you can speak to someone who has a medical degree.And we'll see what happens from there.So when we finish our short session on Friday night, you were considered considerably calmer and experiencing less emotional pain and the goal.We spoke about was to take it easy for the weekend.Today is Monday.Today is Monday.So, how was your weekend?Did you wash your stinking?allowing what to seep into other aspectsSo there are few things that just have come up and what you said.There's the area of your girlfriend being in the nurture and Roll But and you didn't say what I'm about to say, am I accurate and interpreting or entering that you're not comfortable being in a roll of more of a receiver and a sense am I wrong?So behind that there is I should mostly be bright Paws and both positive cheerful self.So it's not surprising if you're so hard on yourself and then not comfortably unconditionally accepting yourself that it would be easy to find it difficult to receive unconditional acceptance from another when you're not being Miss perky cheerful.Happy bright Jesup.In your assessment.I haven't heard from you that she's complaining.Might be like what?Yes.rewardedwell now at your age.Jessa you can continue to practice the attitude that your mother modeled for you or you can stop that crap your choice since you serious since you clearly now that your mother's Behavior was not healthy.You're right at this point as you now share your thoughts when you say it doesn't come natural will surprise surprise.How many sessions have we had?No, this is V.So you have expected to have mastered it by now you expected to have change 30 something years of habit by now.Do you think if you can step back and be a little and be a little objective and considering that that what you held was something of an unrealistic expectation?The good news is you're probably going to have you're probably going to live a bit longer.Oh, at least ninety years that was a joke.And in any case now, you can continue to make effort and change what has felt so automatic until now because indeed it was modeled.You didn't question it you took it on and so it became your attitude towards yourself from what you told me.But now you do now you do unhelpful attitude to yourself.You are not alone and having a tendency to think something is unfamiliar than extrapolating and thinking it is too hard and then extrapolating from sinking it is too hard to thinking I'm not good enough I can't or I won't be able to succeed and keeping yourself in a little in a little limited restricted box instead of continuing to make effort one step at a time when there's a relapse you pick yourself up and keep going.But again, I want to relate to you that in four sessions so far.We have noticed changes in your life.That's pretty good.Don't you think so?So noticed your tendency to be so difficult and demanding on yourself so hard in a tough way that you would not be able not would not be to your students or to the people you helped nor to the people you care about so watch that and work hard at changing it.So when when with awareness you noticed these old harmful ways present modify you're sticking telling yourself here.I go again.Stop Jack.You can say that to yourself.The second thing I want to mention relation to what you said about 10 minutes ago.When you said you feel depressed tell me that is the queue for us asking yourself.What?What what would you ask yourself when you recognize that you are feeling depressed.What is the Mantra when we recognize we're feeling an unhealthy emotion.Know what do you ask yourself first?Okay, here it is.What am I telling myself to make myself depressed when you said just now I am a fallible human you jumped already to the effective New Philosophy.Let's figure out again what you're telling yourself to make yourself depressed and I'm not overlooking the fact that your physical pain in the steroids and whatever is going on chemically is having some effect.Nonetheless, you have courageously demonstrated that even when you're suffering in those ways you're able to make some helpful effort and change.gently gentlyto make yourself depressedandThose thoughts won't create depression.What do you add to them?No, not on their own.That doesn't create depression.The word you said don't create the expression which usually comes from adding shoulds showed or musk, for example, and I shouldn't be that way.That doesn't create depression.Okay, now seriously should sound look for the shoulds in the muss so start again.Start again.And do you add that would be awful?Let's not forget your talent for awfulizing.There you go.orand if I don't thenand if they don't thenand if I don't thenand thenand thenyou will be severely depressed because you're telling yourself that all of the above are awful awful awful awful awful.And you tell yourself that you just can't stand that and you'll never survive and it shouldn't be that way.The homeless people.I wonder whether she is or more depressed than you.I have a hunch.It might be less.She may be unconditionally accepting where she is at in life and not catastrophic sizing.Oh, so she has a nice location?You can join her if you lose your job.It is called rebt, by the way.It is not see what you just said.You were demanding.You should get in in a Flash.San Diegono, I think if you should I think I should call nine one and have you arrested.Yeah, who is Van?Good.I think it is quite healthy not to like what is not helpful.Good.I'm glad you're saying it that way.so answer your question, why do I think like this why it have I become like this the answer isPerhaps you didn't know you had a choice.but nowBut now you do.Yes.The shirts and the lack of unconditional acceptance and the awfulizing and the Catalyst drop resizing contribute significantly.Well, if you look around what do you mean when you look at everyone else?Well what you should eat what you just said our statement of fact and it is unlikely that those statements on their own because depression a late Elation Whisper Ridge.This what you add to this statement of facts.Therefore it should the awfulizing the self-determination or the damnation of them.So that is the detective work.What I just done is to remind you that when you identify and unhealthy emotion, which you haven't too much in the past.You said you felt depressed.It was more anxiety wasn't it would investigate which thoughts are creating it.But today I heard you and in so we've just done what we've done and you've gone.Wow.Okay, so what did so what what did we just do?Right.So what stage is that?looking for beliefsWhat stage is that in the ABC?just to beyes.In the sea the consequence of the act of the eating event.Is the depression?So whatever minded you is when you recognize an unhealthy emotion, the Mantra or the question to ask yourself is what am I telling myself to create this?And then you do detective work.So then what happened?What is the next step after doing what you've just done and done very well a few minutes go in finding the shirts this clear to you when you described her ABS or something that thing itself is not what is getting you in trouble.My friends can go to the gym and it's clear that factor thought is not what causes it that depression.Is it clear it is what you add to.All right.So what is the next step?Well, then you identify the emotion that is unhealthy and that you want to change.After you identified your irrational beliefs.So could you now please dispute the should and must that you just scared like that your depression in this instance.Do your best?rightDo you have any other irrational beliefs bad?You did a good bunch.It was quite a smorgasbord there.Yes, very good.Yes.the disputeyou mean until now you've had trouble.What are you demanding?That is be less difficult.Well, it is not less difficult right now.Can you accept that?If no and say fustrated.to which other placehello.Could you dispute that right now?Pause let that sink in.And if you let yourself believe that what is the outcome?Hello.Right, right.And so when you take the pressure off yourself, do you feel differently?So is this something you be willing to?Keep doing.And do you see how I'm powering?This isBecause it is you being the master or mistress, whatever you prefer four of your own emotional destiny.It is you taking the role of Captain watching the ship watching the turbulent environment making a choice about how you perceive what is going on in the attitude working on having greater compassion for yourself as you identify the old habitual self-determination.And disputing and disputation disputing and disputing so that creates healthy emotions.Can you see?Well, it depends on the degree of neurosis Average Joe and Madame intelligence cheese it has.Most important is understanding is officially the rebt techniques.And more important is applying them and taking action and being motivated.Tremendously in many cases and make significant difference.cuz ifI hope you do even people with psychosis who manage them with appropriate medication can benefit.At the very least I've seen many work on adopting Creator unconditional self-acceptance where they remind themselves that they have work even with their disability.I don't know, but let's get back to looking at you.Good, I'm glad.You seem less depressed.Even though we haven't finished the process.Is there some more disputing you would do?And then is there not another step?Okay.And let me point out to you.Tu, TennesseeAnd let me point out to you Tennessee you have and you know, we're on the same page the Journey of Jessa having a better life when I point out things it is to help you become more aware.So the easy tendency you have if you like yourself is to be distracted to shift Focus.So just watch it.Just watch it.It is perhaps is partly contributed to because you are very bright.You do get stimulated when you're encouraged Your Enthusiasm flares in your heart from disputing to asking about is this good for intelligent people before you have completed the disputed?So just watch that.And if you catch yourself not to tell yourself all goodness.Look at me hopeless blah blah, buttell yourself something like oh there I went again.Okay now I go back to where I was.Let's try to make it an intention in is my recommendation to do your best to listen to yourself as well as you might perceive that I listen to you.makes sensegood.All right back to disputing.Are you saying unfair as is it shouldn't be?disputaCongratulations.For being a psychic.Well, you just said to me before even attempting it that is going to be challenging.What day it is going to be challenging then?Maybe it is going to be challenging, but maybe it won't be.So is that voice of I should be doing this right or should be easier coming up?What are you going to tell that?All right now dispute.That you feel what?It is not that is okay.But it is not desirable but it is is the way it is and you're taking medication.Aren't you?anddispute dispute disputeSo therefore it is awful and terrible that you not found the perfect solution to your Melodies and that you're still suffering some physical consequences.Because you are.you're doingyes.there's no perfect solution perhapsit seems that it is so.And you're taking action?Okay, so more disputed.Let us get back to that.disputeWhat is the reality?And how late were you for session by the way, not late.timed wellCould you control that?Just get to the shirts.Does that make you a terrible person?Yes dispute.dispute disputeAnd there's the part of being a fallible human.Maybeand if she doesprobablywe hopeI'm joking.You realize that right?As I shouldn't be.Which I'm encouraging you to do, too.creates the depression anxiety and thethe Bastilleshould have called me.And not doing that.as Iso it is tough.You say try.All right talk to me will exchange rules.I should have called you Jessa when I was going to be late and makes me an irresponsible.No good person.I feel disgusting.I feel I'm not acting adult enough.I I just feel depressed.Shouldn't I be more responsible?Yes, you are in Reverse roles.It is just not good enough visit.When I'm not really on top of everything should not be after all.What do you mean now Shania be an example of a really fine efficient human being especially if I work with young kids and all should notbut I should be better than that.I mean I was taught to have high standards.Are you suggesting suggesting?I not be hard on myself.Really?Okay, and a role-play Jessa.I think you're very talented at tutoring yourself.When you think the way I express when I was role-playing would you agree?So again, can you complete the disputing of that last Point without having to do it perfectly?May I throw that in?You tell me the probable answer.And this idea that you and we went over this before that you should be able to do it by now.We went over this it is.It is your tendency to demand Perfection from yourself.I'm glad you noticed that.But you see how are you?It makes a lot of sense because you are putting insane insane pressure on yourself your choice.Am I putting the pressure on you to do it perfectly well.I am encouraging you to dispute I'm energetic.What am I telling you do it perfectly well Chessa.No, so you're adding that.Are you not?So that is my hypothesis.You're finding it is hard because you add to the task.You should be able to do it better.You should do it, right.So you just notice you have the primary kind of disturbing motion and that what is called the secondary one you worry about that so back to disputed.sobeen a model of efficiency and perfectiondisputeas I should becould you justBecause of your demand that you should be perfect.Which one?So what so it is hard?Well, you started to dispute it get back to it.What is the irrational belief and then dispute it?the first of all, were you aware that all those assumptions are self created by you becauseokay.Okay, can you read my mind?So how can you assume with certainty that I have those attitudes that you assumed I would have none of which I do or by the way or would have by the way.Well notice that you told me that you believed in your drama queen friend who is not a doctor was telling you you're going to be paralyzed for the rest of your life.Is the same tendency to assume and not question assuming not question.So time is moving on and we're not going to have time now.Okay write them down and then I'll talk to you.No, focus focus on one thing at a time.How is that for a quaint idea?Okay, so you haven't disputed all of the irrational beliefs that you came up with you came up with a good many well done with that.And in the interest of time just working now on those ones you did to see it in the last 10 minutes.Come up with the active new philosophy in relation to the irrational beliefs that you've disputed.imperfectlyDid you hear that?rightThere may be no perfect solution.And I can keep investigating.I can stand not having the one perfect solution which may not even exist.How does that sound?And can I stand it?Unless you let yourself.And when you make yourself depressed about either your physical condition or you're doing this process in perfectly.What is the effective new philosophy?I can accept myself unconditionally.What was the last thing you said?Good to hear you say that right?You're making it scary by demanding.What Eureka here we go again.Goodbye.You're noticing this.What are you telling yourself to make make it scary?So are you willing to accept that up until this recent point you haven't known more because if you had no more you might have done things differently, but here we are.The past is the past.And you have the freedom and choice to imperfectly step-by-step regarding creating a healthier inner emotional life.Yes.So dwell on what you didn't know about how you suffered or think about.I'm ready.I'm already changing myself at times and I can continue to your choice.Yes.so in the time we've had tonight, we actually actually didn't even discuss your last week's homework, which was toTo dispute ideas about your parents in the write down used to eat in a few of our sessions you pointed out included tonight that you would like more comfort and familiar familiar with the D stuff and the Easter.And that will only come with from practice.Including making mistakes and not making mistakes.So did you do your homework?Did you feel some progress?disputingif we let ourselves benew BehaviorThat would be good for you.If you put that in the effort.Which takes first awareness and catching the old habitual thoughts and actions in challenging not leaving them on question.It can be enlightening if you choose to see that it see it that way the situation on Friday night where you unthinkingly took literally didn't question what the guy told you in the result was hysteria and then when you stopped and thought about it, you felt a calm within you felt calm within a very short time.Well done.So you've been assertive with your drama queen friend?Minnesota with your dadand your dad hasn't disowns you yet.And I don't know what what your friend is going to do or whatever.HeYes, who told you that you were going to be?Oh your drama queen friends.Yes.However, it would be very good for you.If he could do another performance like that to give you the opportunity to assess how much you're going to take him seriously or not and to give you the opportunity to not upset yourself.However, we so we shall see what will be will be but the important thing now is to keep on practicing your awareness and help the willingness to continue to be gentler on gentler on yourself in Unconditionally accepted and at peace with you as an improper imperfect human being like the rest of us.An imperfect human being who is blessed with many gifts, by the way.There's not about not enjoying your assets.Celebrate them enjoy them.But know that they are just asked and essentially with or without them your acceptable.If you make mistakes, the mistakes may not be permanent.You can work on changing them.But you are a person of worth bottom line.That would be a good healthy being to work on having more of more of the time.Yes, Jessica.homeworkWhat do you do you think would be helpful?What do you think would be helpful for you to work on this week?So be more thorough in your expression of your irrational beliefs.That's not so easy for everyone and anyone but but apparently that is easier for you than the disputed.And what you recognize tonight is that it will serve you well to be more thorough and expressing the irrational beliefs.So yes, let's make the that apart of your homework.May I give you more?Well, I want the whole ABCDE.I want the whole enchilada as they would say, I don't know who came up with that expression, butSo yes, I would like you to do a good number of the ABCDE all the way the full process.Thoroughly, so yes more thoroughly be which is what you just came up with would be good for you and Sara Lee a the release easterly D & P really eat.I'm past weeks.You've said you're really comfortable with D&E.So.yes more ofyes.Will reminding yourself that you don't need to do it perfectly well.I'm urging you to do it the best you can and when we get together for next session, we will go over that.Specifically I would like you and tell me what you think of this to do one or some ABCDE relation to when you make yourself feel depressed.And could include one around that activated activating event connected to your girlfriend and your expectations of yourself of yourself.So on the depression, you can use the instance of your girlfriend and anything and everything else.I'm sure the week will bring you opportunities.And again, I'm just underlining the primary goal of your homework in this coming week is greater service.And identify meeting the Beast that you come up with that and the Deez and the eve switch for a few weeks.You have said you're not really comfortable with.Make sense.Will you do that?hahahaAlright any final comments thoughts or questions before you finish tonight?Yes, which is not to deny that in some people.There is thethe biochemical componentsvery clear shoulds.And you're not in a feeling of depression for days and months and weeks.Is fairly safe to assume that it is not the biochemical but your shirts that are creating or largely creating it.You know it is it is it is often fairly clear when there is also the biochemical.Would you agree with me in your innocence that you described tonight?Despite being on steroids and the pain?It was your shed.All right.so any otherJust do your ABCs.How are you feeling now in comparison to how you felt an hour or so ago?What are rational?Are you feeling as frustrated anxious or depressed as you?And why do you think that is?So you're feeling you said more Powers you're feeling therefore.I guess less a victim of the circumstances.And you have a different a slightly different attitude.So I'm just pointing out till you notice in yourself you have related to related to me that you feel different and what better way.You did it.Did you see that?Okay, well done.Keep up the good work.Okay, you filled out your dissertations.How was it to do that?Yeah.Yep.Yep.What I don't know is are these so before looking at this are they on your mind is Concepts pretty readily.hahahaYeah, yeah, so well-versed and intellectually and then there's Concepts and it sounds like you've been recognizing it and someone else pretty quickly.And yourself is another thing.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, we're there any that did not but did feel ambiguous or anything you want to talk about specifically as you were feeling it out.What was the example that you gave?Yes.Yes.No, but I follow you as an example and non example, can you identify what is the feeling then?So if your reasoning with emotions, what is the emotion?Yeah, so does this I actually think this is one of the hardest ones for people to really get inside themselves and work with.More than any of the others they get in till actually a grass for one, but then you need to from intellect down to the emotion.This one basically the idea is that if you have a feeling it does not mean that is indicating a fact about a situation, right?You got that sea urchin afraid that something will never change.Is that what's the thought?Yep.Yeah.Yeah, this example I think is a little complicated for good reason.That's what you're bringing up.So for example, I hear you also and what you're describing what if this never changes.If there's still a lot of anger.Because there's not just oh things were exactly what I thought they were and then he's changed a lot and I'm just not giving him credit for that.He's changing and yet that's coupled with your also knowing and still coming into knowing.That he has never where you thought he was to begin with.So it does sound like you have some realistic anxiety actually not just a rational about what if he changes a lot and that's still where he wants to still feels like it's not enough for me.Yeah you again that sounds more.Like it's a worry Basin some understanding of the possibilities of reality.What if for example for him to feel like he was functioning at his best in a life that he was happy with you was going to be a manager at Subway for the next 20 years.You have to take in your breath evenand he was happy doing that and he managed to find some way of functioning while doing that.What do you do then?Is that enough for you?hahaYep.Yep.So just press you for a second.Does your mind go to something in particular?What are you saying?What does it say about me?It seems like you get very self-critical.I want to know if there's a way you sort of discount.It has it shouldn't matter at all.But your snobby is at what that's about.So why would it not be good enough?Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.If you were a doctor right now.Making a ton of money and working all the time.So you never saw him.like in other words like your fatherI would certainly imagine that you would have a problem with that, too.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah in a way then with your father.That's what you were used to to sort of getting to feel good about with his at least.Is really driven successful smart.Yeah.Also, maybe in a way he's not there for you, but is very professionally successful maybe with Ivan right now.It's feeling like you're not getting either of those you haven't been getting either of those.It's not that he's the opposite of your dad and always there for you always catering to you buy me flowers figuring out what you need to know putting you front and center and he's not that successful there.So it feels like both Realms you're missing out and I think that's what has been really disappointing.Yeah.Yeah, all of what you're talkin about that started with this particular disc Distortion.It does sound Ramona.I've said this before but you just say again because you're acting class what you're thinking about his job and only I must be very snobby if that's not good enough for me.It really sounds like you're sayingYou are not drawn to him not being passionately practically engaged in something which is very different than saying.I just can't be married to someone who's a Subway manager.What you still might have a problem with some people might some people might not for various reasons, right?There are different things that kill valuable to people but if she had come to you two years ago, but you know what, I love retail, I love you know, like multitasking and I thinking I went to work to become an owner of a store one day orino buy a franchise.This is why I'm going to get into what do you think of Subway and if it had?So thoughtful and proactive and driven by a passion for something passion for sandwich events, you know, like, you know, he's starting to learn about all different kinds.I mean, but still might be disappointing in one way if it was sort of Oh, I thought I was marrying someone who's going to this and what does that mean for his identity and you know, can I get used to that but maybe not in all the ways it's been disappointing because there's something in his personality or attention deficitYou know what?I mean?Yep, he even can acknowledge that.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Your two choices of Role Models wear that or your mom.And not a lot of space in there in either case where someone actually taken care of you really really loving and being there for you.Maybe in your sister.That's as close as you got.Yeah.Yeah.It's actually a hard job.Yeah, it's a lot of responsibilities and tasks.Yeah, and yet I also hear what you're saying and it still feels like it's kind of holding ground in a way rather than a sense of being chosen Representatives stop in him.And that may be what steering right with scary right now is how little since he has about the futureis everythingyeah.Ramona how is your depression anxiety been this week?Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, you're saying the day can be going well even between you and Ivan.Maybe on any given day and you can still feel you said specifically down on yourself.Not just lonely, but specifically self-critical.Yeah.Yeah.So where do your thoughts go in that place when you say down on yourself, like what are the thoughts and that emotional low?like at a job interview you meanOkay, see you can think of an example specifically you named a couple saying it could be that as it could be that is there something you remember it at all happening since I saw you last.So you were in the story mean?Try things on.Okay, she's ready to go when you're still.You're burning her.Is so striking how quickly can escalate to I hate myself which is such a strong thing to say about yourself.No, no, I hear you.I hear you.It's almost like you don't realize how many that is.You're just used to that being the running threat almost.To say I hate myself for something like why is it necessary to feel bad when someone gives you a gift?So one of the things I wonder because you're describing it both in money.And then also in time your sisters time if it is been hard for you to be given to like really for someone to lovingly give you something that you to you that you take it sounds like that's hard.Yeah.You feel guilty.You feel like you didn't deserve it.You feel like you're taking from them.It's like an absence Ramona inside you..Foundation of just having been given to lovingly give it to just knowing that's part of the way of loving relationships work.I think this comes up a little here with me too.But what if I were to give you in a way as a metaphor a second session to help you and say I want to help you.I want to give this to you.I want take care.Hope you feel better.I think that's disorienting for you.Like you almost don't be used to being having to the whip out people mistreating.You people not taken care of you having to scramble to make sure you take care of other people.Yeah.She is yeah.Yeah.It's interesting.It's a dynamic that's gotten set up with her.It sounds like since you were very little.Oh, she's doing in a way that should have happened with your own mother so that your sister and you could be freed up to have a sister relationship instead of more mothering one.So that's what's so complicated.Then you actually get this loving care what you need and yet it's in a place that leaves you with kind of Rocky feelings about it because it's not actually where it should be coming from even more soYou didn't get enough.So here's here's where I so coming back to your specific scenario.One of the things that I think it's a story where their self hatred comes up is what you're saying right now that you should no longer need that.I don't think that's true.I think you were incredibly deprived as a child what you need of what you needed, but I think adults need that too.And that's actually what you hope to find in friends and partners killing one's mother and father right even as an adult you've asked the number of times.What does that actually look like lacking of all models for example about what does it look like when a healthy married couples doing it?Well,and I thinkit includes being quote somewhat mother Ali if you were going to use that as The Stereotype of what itmean to say to someone.How was your day?How is that going?You know, how was Interview?Oh, have you done this?Oh, how are you feeling?You were sick yesterday the kind of following up on.If we're just calling that basically seeing caring about the life of another person.It's fundamental to every healthy relationship not something you need to get over.That's what you want to be part of your marriage and you want it to be reciprocal.That's what's different about not being motherly right in that place.It's a mother's job to be that caring concern child and for the child not necessarily early on to eat have to even think about how the mother is doing so much overtime easily get to know moms having a bad day at maybe I'll set the table for her or something like that.But I think you have to be so preoccupied about what your mother's mind.Way way too young in your life.You were deprived of it and yet it's normal.It's a normal healthy part of relationships.Like for example, this is what I say when you're going to the mall to go shopping.On any given any different relationship any given day, you're not being selfish by having your sister away a little bit too while you try on clothes.It could be as she said to you Ramona.I have 30 minutes and then I have to be out of here because I have a job interview.So Su 30 minutes and then you know say you were driving her and then you kept trying on clothes and totally ignoring her deadline.I'm guessing that's not what happened, right?She didn't say she had limited time.So what did what she does for you there sounds like part of a healthy relationship even sister hood that that could exist in a way.That's not a problem at all.It's healthier if you're doing that for her sometimes too if it's reciprocated and it sounds like she has had a hard time taking that in.So that might be the growing edge of a relationship with her.Is to be able to start saying you know, what when are you going to try on clothes?Because I want to be there for you.I want I have some time right now pushing into taking care of her son, but I don't think the answer is going to be.Oh you just need to not be taken care of anymore.I think you start to hate yourself when you get taken care of and that's the healthy.That's a healthy thing.You want to happen every relationship.Do you know what I mean?So even there may be ways this plays out with Ivan.Sometimes can you be taken care of by him?Is there anything he could do that?We actually take care of you.And can you all go ahead?Oh, huh?Yep.Yeah.something more emotionalThat's so we have 5 minutes.A little actually we started a couple minutes.So it's 7 minutes.It's so interesting because of some ways that started making explicit.Here's what I need to be taken care of.Can you do this thing and not only can you do it, but can I take it in then?What is it like when this need gets meant?Have you thought of anything?Busy right now Ramona everyday say oh, how was your day?Yeah.Yeah.Yeah shirts.Is it starting to feel like to feel kind of like you're hopeless Ness is Raising.So it gets harder to do to go to then go do the things that you feel like nothing is going to come of this anyway.Scooter stores in a distortion challenging thought just to throw us in the mix and this was my fear when you were trying to apply for jobs all the way from the beginning was that you were going to expect something was going to work out within the first month or two even pretty much every single person who applies for a job in whatever field right.Now the average time to get a job at 6 to 8 months at least right that is a state of affairs and employment.It's incredibly competitive.There are people applying for jobs are extremely overqualified there people applying for jobs that then gets filled internally.They only had to advertise it, you know what I mean?So it sounds like you really need to work hard to adjust your expectations about the time frame and I think more about applying for your job at your job.meaningbut you said specific times if it comes listening?I have to get I have to get I have to get I have to get and you're going to build hopelessness every day that passes with the more you start say Okay example looking at my job or every day 7 days a week sounds like the fastest way to get yourself feeling hopeless because you're going to reach a point where new things are going to come up.It's going to feel like beating your head against the wall.So I mean, I wonder if you could Slot 2 or 3 days where you look and letting it go on the other days getting specific time frames where you don't work on things and just be thinking of this as this is part of what you're doing in the backdrop.I don't think if it feels like you have to get another job in the meantime, if you knew for example right now it's going to take eight months until you find job.You would.Yeah.yep, I think one of the hardest things for you about this process in the reality of finding and solidifying a job which is not just for you but for anyone and probably specifically for any new graduate in the field where you're coming with less experience and someone else is the hit rate is very very very low meaning you could go through 300 applications and one of them will come toand the problem is let's sayYou get up to 211th and then 212 and 213 and what you're saying to yourself I put in 213 applications and not a single one has come to fruition.So it can feel more helpless, but if you're going to but if you know on the back of your mind that one and three hundred you'll get a job offer the less you start going off right now.You actually are decreasing your chances of getting a job.It's just a low hit rate.Right like imagine the pitting the pigeons hitting and every 300 * 1 + 300 going to go off and you'll get the food palette.So if it stops taking it's definitely not going to get the food pellet, but it's very very very very infrequent reinforcement.And I think that's part of what's Happening you're doing something and something happens, you know, you know, right cause and effect immediate effect of your option action you go clean, it's clean.So this is really hard to kind of persist and I know that the reinforcements will come but it's very very infrequently enforcement.It's just that those are the facts.So the more you start with challenging Moscato, it's hopeless with I don't know what you could replace that with has an effect everything.I do might have an effect, but I just don't know which is going to have an effect on your also giving yourself days off or you're notOkay.Yeah, do you think it would help you Ramona to have something part-time that you were doing?And I mean that specifically around forget even the money was so you had money would it help you to?Restructure to have something to go to part-time.OU 200Yeah.Okay.Okay.It's building a resume.It's going to help.Yeah.Yeah, also telling yourself a year from now you'll be somewhere.I know that's a long ways away but it will happen.I think it's also with Ivan something is going to happen and enough will happen that you will feel better or nothing will happen and you will feel worse, but you'll know more in a year.This is the hardest time ever.So try and take a deep breath and just trust that something is going to happen and you're not going to be in this place forever and every little thing you do might be the thing that gets you in the door somewhere.If you get sick of it give yourself a day off, but then you get back on the horse and you keep riding and just sort of keep imagining yourself being that pigeon.And you don't know which one is going to be but one of them is going to get the pallet out.Okay.Alright keep journaling.If there's a specific Distortion at some point.Any one of these it comes up something where you get overwhelmed with self-hatred specifically and Escalades right about it.Okay?And then bring it in and talk about it.I would love to look at over.Yeah.He said that a balance that I I have new that's incorrect, but it turns out it was more like my bill cross your thing your check kind of thing.So yeah.Sure.Yeah.But I can see in addition to that how it reflects your not doing well partly because of it sounds like you're saying.But you feel more abandon.Correct.Correct.Maybe you feel more been into but that's not what I had in mind.surepoint the rug outyou sounded worse me actually the last week.At first when you said about feelings for your less dependent like putting stuff out there.I wasn't sure.In a way good thing coming from it.We talked about last time it doesn't seem that way as we talked more.It seems like you don't care in the way that even when you're feeling pretty bad.You generally still do.Yeah, I haven't forgot.I'm just I'm trying to remember the last time it was like this.It's been awhile.On one hand it's mostly in.automation of self-hatred and fighting amongst yourselfYeah, which I guess which I guess you're a complete disaster.I guess my point being my box over there.I guess that my point was that that's how I imagined.It felt.That's part of what itFeel so awful.Is that so far?So the main thing is that you're feeling quite a bit miserable in a tremendous amount of emotional pain.my kind of it sounds like that part of the story isn't feeling at Central as other times it you know, and it sounds like also this doesn't have the kind of beat yourself up quality of feeling low can has for you it's more likewhenever like I get a sense that you're indulging yourself a lot or blaming to yourself or feeling.Inadequate sometimes you're just feeling awful.my sensation to not being able to get out of Corner in a video game is that it's kind of disorienting among other things like you can't they move and you can't figure out where you're looking andYeah, and you're welcome.Have imagined in some ways.It's actually worse in that not only are we inviting you but especially James and someway is making you feel obligated.I think that's especially.I complete like I completely crave.Tuna.I'm not saying you're saying.No, I think about it.Yeah, you're right.But there's a language that people are referring to you.Maybe think.I don't understand what you mean by that butthere are ways in the short-term, you know.Okay.Are you surprised?Yeah.And why keep going in spite of how excruciating it is?I imagine that feels like a lot of things have been a failure for you.That's all beyond me.How do you think?There are no good options.It's not really been bearable.the only thing in particular that I canI have you been thinking about of doing it to yourself.When's it at?Is James at home or out somewhere?What did he say when youdid you watch anything yesterday?No, are you sure of that?Yeah, I know I continue to put the decision about this in your hands, but I assume and I want to make sure I'm correct that you really don't want to go to the hospital.Yeah.But something that's not a whole lot.You're pretty sure you'll cancel the tutoring session.How long is it?around 23 yeah.Okay.I think that's why because particularly after 3 hours of holding it together you couldin that case and then what likeNow, let's wait on that one.I mean to use it.You know, I'm not joining that you're feeling a bunch of pressure for me to make a plan not to kill yourself in to stay alive.And that feels pretty awful.Sure.We're getting a minute where it's coming from.Is that the pressure that you're feeling?I see.If you do it won't be for you.Yeah, I'mup to my I mean, I'm perfectly aware that at the end of the day I can keep you from killing yourself.You know what you know that.I also know that you don't often want to with the intensity or with as much as yourself or something like that.I also know that you might feel better in a few hours or not this bad.Yeah, I'm actually sort of inclined to think that I mean, I don't need to be at Mystic.Yeah.I mean, I guess one that I have is you know, if you're going to go home most likely will take a nap and then touch base a little after 6 or something.When you get home from the hospital.Which I could probably be anytime, you know.Why doesn't James have a hand in it?Yeah, it didn't feel like to me.It didn't feel to me like we were all that close to death until see I mean, I knew that death you told me buthe's absolutely right, of course that likeHe always seems like current time or Jag but there's no guarantee about the next one will come.Sorry, I'm taking a little time to figure this out.Do you have aActually, the truth is the truth is always ended up the former.so farYes, that's true.But as long as you're around.You know, I don't like it.I think James should come and you guys should go to the ER and I think it's possible by the time I see you you're feeling better enough or you think you're feeling a little better.If you're waiting there for three or four hours you start to feel better.Call me and you can come back here and we can talk.You know this evening either of them you can come by and we can go from there.I'm happy to do that.ButThere's something about that.kind of angry abandoned that's got me concerned in a way thatI think I was at times last year.my worry about that is I mean my concerns might a psychological point of view is thatthis will convey to you.There's something about that kind of anger hostility being with James thatYou know is always going to be dangerous.So I'm somewhat concerned about that.Yeah, right.See what happens when you're unconscious.Yeah, I think that'll that probably a good plan is love Jaymes come by you guys go to the ER you'll probably have to wait a while there.Anyway, if you start to feel better, you know, call me and you can come in a little later and we'll talk some more and go from there.And if you don't feel better stay there, I guess the first question is does it seem in my putting you in a reasonable position?I don't want to put you in a position where you're having to make a decision is overwhelming.Do you sitting waiting in the ER and if that's the case?I don't know I would have assumed so but I don't know they can I'm sure they can get me on the phone or you guys likely can call me on your cell phone or something and I can come and get you and we can sort of and we can sort it out that way.Yeah, let's see.So how do you want to do this?You want to just call James now from here you want to do you want me to hear while you call them?Call him?Oh, that's alright.Don't worry.I don't really.Do you know how long he'll be?Okay, will he want to talk with me?I mean how I guess what I wasOkay.Alright, that's fine.I'll be 10 minutes.I'm going to eat some bread.Do you want anything?You sure.Okay.Do you like have the contact information?You got it on my iPad.I thought I just saw the first few flakes.so it isyeah.Yeah, you had you had been I think hemming and hawing about whether you're going to or not.Way too much.In what?Okay.Sorry, what's hurting?That did used to hurt.I know I haven't heard for a while.I don't think we talked about it for a while.Sorry, it's a what?Are you mean it was really big to go in and look around for Stuff?Yeah.And have you had that you had you said you hadn't had the experience before of not also having the great to see you guys feeling have you been irritated to this extent?That's terrible.Yes.Those are bad but different.I can imagine that exhaust for exacerbating a bunch of things already bothered you.What I'm wondering about is in the medication, I meanI'm like these aren't side effects.They're part of what's affecting you it sounds like the sort of thing is supposed to be helping with and then the other stuff you would help more with or whatever.Didn't get an away.I mean, I know you're having a hard time.It's not like I'm going toit's not like I'm I'm not intending to just blame everything on the medicine, but in that your reaction to this was so different.Yeah.I mean from where I sit on my hunch, it might be the medication because it seems to me there other times you've been.Really pretty low.We need to talk more about it.I wish I had thought this through more carefully and the medication obviously might have might have but also just I sort of don't buy that you get irritated by being worried about being irritated compared to how you usually are for something like this, you know, even if it was so mark, it doesn't sound like unless I'm misunderstanding the kind of difference by I'm just focus on being irritated, which I don't want to be and yet worried about being and it's making me more irritated but feels like a small difference.But it seems like a big difference.You've been to many conventions and as I understand and this reaction, I've not heard you talk.I mean, I've heard you describe annoying things or people inventions are other things that have happened, but this is like really not enjoying the genre.So there is more of that stuff than they're usually then they're generally is.24 hoursreally annoyingWell, you just said you just had been over crowded all weekend.I think.PetSmart kittensI see there would have been feeling of you getting up and walking out.I see.I would imagine.It was not touched at all also part of her.In part of her top she was discussing.A lot of for African-American African students didn't do a whole lot with technology under under represented in the tech field.And that's true.The tech field is very white.Your comment was it's because they're not be encouraged to go into Tech and we don't see it as a possibility and we just need to be encouraged and I thought no that's not really actually the problem.The problem is systemic racism, but sure.You mean through both educational system in the technology field in particular?ironicallySophomoric, yeah.You mean because of how you're feeling from that?Sorry, did you see your undergrad in?OIC yes, that makes sense.So like Anthropologie.Brewster here was really quite naive incompetent and kind of offensive tothis may be very naive on my part.But I would imagine a white person and African American studies would have thought that would have thought about or like have had to deal with being comfortable talking about that kind of stuff.I mean clearly not or something.Right and they won't necessarily learn better, I guess.Actually does yeah.Yes, I can see that too.Although even just in literature by the time you're a postdoc you think that you can't get away with purely looking at the internal structure of the books.You're reading or something like that.I don't really know.I'm wondering about an answer to this might just be know is are you doing that thing at all?Where I mean when somebody pisses you off.You tend to be a little more critical.You know what I'm thinking about story that the Cambridge Business review story.I'm not sure all the all of us what's going on, but it did cross my mind to ask.It's not that I don't believe you believe she could be that bad.I justyeah.Yeah what I might have caught as well probably not but I think I get what you mean.That's not like there's a lot going on there that's reflective of her point of view.Yeah, the more I think about it, that's reallyYeah.Yeah, you're done.I wouldn't go so far as to say you were just being super critical because you were mad.I was wondering if that was a piece of it.You know what I mean?I don't doubt that.She had the problems you describe.I have the sense that from the incident.Sometimes you push you push a little further and make a person more ridiculous.That's what I'm wondering about, but I don't know.In a good way or not a good way.Yeah.I heard they lost.Sorry about that.I guess she'll be there during a Super Bowl.Oh, no.That's a pretty delayed throwing up.I meanI know you like spit up some phlegm in the morning, but usually don't go throw up like dinner in the morning, you know.We will wait backup.You decided not to take the Adderall because I had you taken it.You would have felt like getting something done and you didn't want to feel like getting anything done so you didn't take it.And you were worried you might start to feel like doing something.Good.I'm glad it's helping it could be reallydifferent yeahfor the weekendfor the daySo, is that your condo?Where is she now?Wright's just wants to cover her own ass.This is the bank.Which Tuesday?About a week from today.So we're off.Okay.Do you want me to send a message later today?We every week orThis one out there.You really do the thing where you feel?There's some clinical terms.You also do this other thing.the second thingYeah, but you don't interrupt randomly you enter up specifically what I'm trying to tell you something.I guess.I think that it's funny.Yeah, where you feel you have this fantasy that you're completely helpless.Yeah.Oh my God.I have no freaking clue what I'm doing with the whole Pinewood Derby car.I just they just don't give us much direction to scout leader is kind of scatterbrained.I don't know if we have the paint to paint on the wood if this it's a Saturday 5 days from now, whatever.I mean there's this thing called the internet or people, you know, I mean, you could look it up in 15 minutes short of a detailed instruction if you want about what to do.I'm sure I'll figure out where to buy the paint or you know, you could probably watch a video on YouTube showing you exactly what to do and you don't need me to tell you this like you've used Google and YouTube before and part of you is like, oh my God, I'm completely overwhelmed.I have no idea what to do.I have as responsibilities way over my head when they can't handle it.It's only five days away.I'm going to let my kid down.I'm anxious and Confused.So it's like striking to me.Are you going to ask one of the other patients parents or you could call the scout leader and ask him or her where to look or you could I mean any one of those things would probably work in again?I'm not saying this to you know, I'm so smart.I have all these ideas you could think of this butmaybe I mean clearly you are feeling anxious when you are feeling overwhelmed.Absolutely and I sense if your anxiety I don't think you're actually I'm not sure that's really mostly what this is about.Another all questioning how you feel, you know, do you feel overwhelmed you feel anxious do you feel and do you feel helpless?I absolutely believe that you do.I know you're not making that up and I know it's really unpleasant.Absolutely.I'm not sure.Is this like a bid for attention?Do you want somebody to run in and help you out or fix it or make it better and tell you what to do.Is it because you know, if you got instructions then you'd actually feel responsible for doing the car doing a job and somehow that would be normal.I don't know.Is there something else?I'm not sure.I guess I sort of think that's the same thing again.I hear what you're saying.You were saying you're sort of like crap C or Carpinteria that way.It's not something that you're comfortable with at the same time.You're smart.You're a smart confident guy.You can probably get pretty good instructions is a fucking Pinewood Derby car.You know what I mean?I don't know if that's what you have.No, I don't know if that you have no confidence.You know, I guess I refuse to believe you don't have the like you're not so smart never stole enough to my get in there and give it a try and have it turn it adequate.You know, I'm sure Ian is probably excited about how it looks when it turns out he feels mostly excited.Just doing it with you, you know, and I'm sure if you like good instructions.Thought about it a little bit.I mean 20 minutes or something before you get.And worked with him on it that you know, you could do more than adequate job.Maybe it would be the best one there or the fastest one or the best-looking one, but it would probably be fine.I guess it doesn't feel like that.I imagine you have the sort of idea that you're justOkay, I think you could do a fine job if you spent, you know, 20 or 30 minutes on Google and YouTube.maybe took a trip to likeSure, Michaels.Shirt that sounds ideal then it's mostly about spending time with the kids doing something together.Maybe you guys will turn out something fine was involved.Did they give you like the parts of a cars and you have to put together orand you have to like you sauce andSo what do you need to add to the top?ICCU haveLike a car with no front back when shields and you need and you kind of need to put those on there.I see that something that has to be wood or can you get it get likeMichael's nails and pieces in a piece of tape in like justor maybe three nails like boom boom boom.And then you put a piece of tape.That's the windshield kind of around the nails and then like, you know what I mean?Then you can even get a Sharpie and you could like draw the windshield wipers.I'm horrible at this stuff so I can pick me up the easiest least Talent way to do it because that's about what I would be up to.How do you get up to this?I think the main thing that gets in your way is that you're afraid to give it a try.So you kind of overweight it and feel helpless and then when you get there and you haven't thought about it at all and you're kind of freaking out a little bit, you know, then it does make things more difficult.Pull it off.What do you think?What?You said you know.What was that?Cameron I don't think you have enough self confidence in yourself when it comes to a lot of things.I think you feel kind of crummy about yourself as a result in part of your lack of confidence.And you know, when you're feeling call me about yourself.It can be hard to be motivated and take care of yourself.You still down and you don't feel like you're worth it.You don't do your laundry.next TuesdayHey.Sorry to hear that.This is like an ER to the hospital or something.Yeah.Yeah.I think some of what you're scared of is like an intensity of your anger at yourself for not being able to handle things.You feel like you should be able to handle.I think now sometimes you do want to kill yourself for that or kill yourself so you don't have to feel that.Well, you probably don't remember this because it was sort of in the throes of the stuff that we had talked about.how not being able to remember things can feel like havingfeel like not having control over things in the way you feel you shouldyeah, and so it can be something you blame yourself alot for I think.Yeah.I think you might worried that I won't react.Well if you hide for a little while.And then I'm going to say something to you that puts some other Demand on you or limitation or burden that you can't bear.That's okay.I'm so sorry that it is.wellI thinkAs far as sort of the Dilemma that you're in which is on the one hand to be inclined to say things like maybe not in an existential sense.But in other senses know some of the way things are.Like this now is on what's making you feel so so bad.And so is how one particular thing sort of happened.They affect you in a in a pretty waste it on the other side.I'm inclined to I'm in line not to say so much aboutbecause you seem pretty maxed out with what you can bear and I think that probablypretty well reflects a dilemma that you're in which is the things that could help weather is understanding or tasks.Sort of things or work often feel like way too much.I think when it comes to this stuff, I think you want to think knowing won't help because I think you don't want to know.We kind of know where a bunch of the bodies are buried at this point.I mean, there's a lot more to learn.I feel like we sort of a bunch and a thing in a number of things.I have become really intolerable for you and some of Y.And it's really hard to keep that in mind.I think I mean like the phone messages I think are actually maybe just the right metaphor like, you know, they're there and it's terrifying because you know, you may not be able to Bear hearing them.and if we wanted to think about it for a few minutes because probably getting much more particular about what would be hard about hearing them the message that you had a job interview, you know, and you never gotNot far from stuff we talked about.Again, I don't have a complete understanding or I'm sure that there's a lot of important contacts that I don't have.But yeah, I think you also.I have no doubt that are moments when you're totally overwhelmed and upset.It feels like you have no idea what's going on or why it's happening butIf you pretend you don't you don't and then anybody who cares any things that there could be reasons clearly doesn't know.I really want to run with that.I don't think you do this too much intentionally, but I think it's sort of related.I think that a lot has happened recently more historically in your life that sort of in reality as the impression that anybody who sing who thinks they have reason doesn't know what they're talking about.Like it may not be I'm just going to throw it out there.So anyway and won't think about it.So there may be times when you're feeling when your feelings are so intent and you come on in your kind of subtle way.So strongly with them that youwe're kind of nearly empty assurances from somebody who are sort of anxious and have a sense of your need and don't know what to do.And that confirms your impression that they clearly have no idea what's going on or what to do.And certainly a lot about the mental health establishment plays right into that two completely apart of you.Well, we should stop for now.Good to see you in person.Yes.Good.What's the story with the partial?I got served by krypted mix a cryptic message from what's your name?Okay, that's what it said.Is it a different one from the last time like it's going on Tuesday?Is he the same person that you had seen when you were just sleep there?What did he do?I have the impression that you're pretty relieved to be feeling a little better.Is your mind just kind of blank?Has it been that way?I mean is that an accumulating thing?Is it is it being here is it?anxietyThat's great.So everything's been okay.I had work one person number years ago who had aDT previous the same knee and I saw somebody else who was referred for it, but decided not to do it.Yeah.You know, what's making your anxious about being here?That makes two of us.Is it making you feel uncomfortable to sit here?I'm sure what to say or are you?All right.Okay good.You feel like you're going to get yourself in some kind of trouble if you start talking.That's all right.Yeah, probably something really important going on if not, knowing what to say, but it will emerge at some point eventually.It happens.Kind of what you feel is mostly kind of sad.maybe a little worried aboutand I gather a bit anxious as well.anxietyYou know what?I wonder if it's safe to say for being in the hospital and also say for doing the kind of treatment that you do there then what goes on here.And you can mostly count on them to not know you particularly well, and I mean at least they make an effort to get to know you like I would too.Yeah, sure.Person use use it in the hospital.It's my impression that in a way.You're in sort of a pretty passive roll.Like you'll get serve poke and prodded and checked in with a month over and so forth.What kind of answer questions and go where you're supposed to go and do what you're supposed to do.More than in a way kind of coming kind of coming from you.Did you Hospital?Do you wish I was asking you questions or things like that?There are times I work more that way.I'm not sure that would be more helpful.Let's see and tomorrow.Yeah, that's okay by 45.Okay good.Where do you want to start today?Yeah.You hear what he's saying?Like do you can you hear in your voice what he's reacting to?Well, you finding a way to say that you're angry, but speaking calmly might make it easier for him to hear what you're really saying.Right.So you do want to find a way that you can have a conversation that you can both participate in if he's shutting down.He's not really participating.And if he's shutting down because he finds a tone to overwhelming.Then it's not really working for you either because you're not being able to express really what you want.Can you delay the conversation until you are called?What does after I spoke to you Monday?The next Friday happened again.What were your plans that day?Is that a feeling that you've shared with him?It seems very honest.Well, it sounds like that's one component of it is not I mean heard it is feeling like there's not enough intimacy, but he's also not following through on other plans that you've made.Oh good.well, I think there's you know, it's apart of it is the quantity of it in that.This is not these are not isolated event.They're not feeling like isolated events anymore.So, you know, you have a right to express your anger.He also has a right to have your feelings expressed to him in a way that feels respectful and I don't know if that's what he's saying that it feels does the tone of your voice feel disrespectful to him.I don't know that's not a word that you used.What feels hurtful about being angry?It feels like you have a right to be angry.rightRight and you sort of you want him to take responsibility for the for the things that he's doing that result in you feeling angry.but the tone feels yelling because the tone feelslike you're reprimanding him.So you keep telling him that you're angry.And he keeps saying I'm sorry.So which one of you is going to stop doing the same thing over and over?So does he not agree that what he's doing is detrimental to the relationship?Oh.That's a really tough pattern that you guys are stuck in because you can't change his behavior.And it seems like they're both of you.You don't really feel like neither one of you feels like you need to change what you're doing.You feel like your anger is appropriate and your expectations of him are appropriate and it sounds like for the most part he feels like what he's doing is appropriate as well.Well, you can't you can't fix him and you can't fix a pattern.You can't change a pattern by yourself.You can only change your response to it.Yes, you are.Why can't you be mad at him?Can he explain why it's not okay for you to be mad.His behavior really just disappoints you.Which is pretty honest it sounds like in reflecting what you really feel.Well, if you want him to hear your message, it sounds like you need to be more in control of the tone of your voice and whether that's being able to take a deep breath and speak calmly even when you don't feel that way or let him know that you're too angry to talk right now and delay the conversation until some of that anger and disappointment has excited.If you want him to hear the words that you're actually saying it sounds like you do need to change your tone whether that's right or wrong isn't the question because if you too if you want to stay in a relationship with him and you want things to change the only piece you have control over is how you respond to the situation and it sounds like right now the response of letting him hear the anger that you feel is resulting in him not really being able to hear your message.She hears the tone and shuts down as he saySo the peace that you have control over is you can change the tone and as I sit here and thinking about the two ways to do that are either to delay it until that anger has subsided or to find a way to take that seat breast and then speak in a way.That's more call.I'm not saying that you don't have a right to be angry or that it's not okay to express your anger.The reason I'm saying this is because he's not hearing you and you want him to hear you.I can understand that you're taking on a lot of the responsibility.I think that's part of why you feel so upset is because you do feel like that.You feel like you're doing your fair share of getting this to work.It feels a bit lopsided.That's certainly it's the story that I've been hearing in here for quite a while.And you know, I am only basing on what you say, but this is not inconsistent with things you said in the past you have felt that you've been taking one more of the responsibility in a relationship and more of the responsibility of caretaking for a long time.Yes, it is.So he's doing some of the things that you expect of him and working through this but not all.That's you know, one of the reasons his sleep bothers you so much is because that feels like something he could be doing to try to get better that he's not.Doing consistently.I'm sorry that you guys are having such a hard time being happy together.You'd feel less dependent on him for your day.You've gotten that in.Good job.But you don't you have control of the sending it in.Peace.So you're doing your job?And the temp agency hasn't come through with anything yet.rightI will follow up and put it on your list that one of your jobs is to follow up with them tomorrow.and I think you know you can be proud of yourself for getting in your one application a week because that's more than you had been doing the weeks prior and I know it didn't result in the way you want it yet, butWell, it's your list.So.Well, let's keep going with that because that's working in to at least get you moving.It hasn't gotten you a job yet.But instead of engaging in an argument with your dad.You weren't harmed in any way.It sounds like it's worth asking a question because I don't I wouldn't know which to pick.Yeah, I mean, I think if there's if there's an internship that interests you and it's unclear about whether or not it's a paid position may be worth a phone call or an email.To find out if there is some sort of stipend or salary or something that goes along with it.But you know if you're not interested in doing the work and he wouldn't apply for it if it were a paid position.I'm not willing to speculate.I don't think people are locking the responses, right?In this job market the employer or the internship holder.It's not really at the burden of trying to get people to apply.I don't think it's worth your energy to debate it.Your goal is to get a job and you can spend a lot of energy trying to make an assessment or assumption about what the employer wants or has to offer.But you don't really know unless you ask.Sure.I'm interested in this position.I noticed that there was no compensation mentioned is compensation available for this position.if you canWhat if we say one with a bonus for two how do you set up that incentive chart for yourself?So that doing that would be one way maybe if there is two that are interesting maybe if you had some sort of incentive and a reward for yourself.You might be more likely to do it.So you see you having some of the same behavior that your boyfriend is having four different things.That is true.Yes, that is true.Well the way I think about it is what's the goal of the reward the goal is not for you to go on a trip.The goal is to get you doing more things that benefit you and apply for jobs benefits you because it's the only way you're going to get a job.You're not going to get a job unless you apply we know that no one application guarantees you a job also because we don't know the outcome of any of them, but if you're not applying you're not getting a job.So the goal is selling have to chart is that it gets you to do things that give you a chance at getting what you want.Sausage shark gets you to apply two more things to not let things that are possibility slip by then.It's doing its job.It's not a freaky trip.but if setting that up for yourself, if setting up a certain number of applications and you get to go on a trip stops you from applying stops you from applying because you don't think you deserve a trip then that's notThat's not helping you either.We need to find something in that gets you to do something to help yourself.Does that help because you felt really guilty for a long time sometimes motivates you sometimes I don't think it does.Right works better for you.rightYeah, so maybe we could look for more things like that.Is there anyone in your daily life that could help hold you accountable to something that you set up?But you can be at your place whenever you want.It doesn't sound like a very long time music.Well that's been working the past couple weeks.So it sounds like sticking with that and not changing that but if you want to add something to it now that you've done it successfully a couple weeks in a row.And you can maybe add something to it, but I wouldn't take away something that's working.This week.Well, it's Monday.You could do that a couple hours a week in addition to applying for a job.It's you I mean one of the things I heard you say earlier is maybe one thing that would help with Sydney is actually being having your day be a little less dependent on him.And I wonder if having you know is setting up some time to go to a place to go to separate from him that you're not Reliant upon him being up at a certain time for you to go to.If that might if I might actually feel good.Yeah, you get out of the house.You see someone.But you get up and out.And I think having a little bit of structure having a place to be even if it's volunteering is a wonderful thing to do.No.No, you don't want to only volunteer forever.Right now volunteering wouldn't really getting in the way of something else you have time to do it.It's longer than you expected.It's a long time.And your field fields are moving differently and your field is one where it's not really being helped.You seem like someone to logical threats to following.I think thinking outside the box has a good idea but thinking about pursuing a different degree that you're not interested in seems like a little bit much of an investment.Well, you can send out job applications, which you're doing some.And you can do the dreaded networking thing.Do you know that the people that you know in libraries don't know people in the field that don't work at the same libraries.soWhat's so generally when people think of networking and they think about the first step not knowing where the other steps are going to lead.That's where networking is right.It's one piece leading to the next piece which leads to the next piece and not knowing where those pieces are going with the hope that something will lead to something productive and you're jumping a couple steps ahead.You're jumping to well.I know this person, but they can't do this very one specific thing for me to get a job at the school.And when you think about networking when you really want to think about is a branch of networks that are all interconnected and you don't know which one goes where you start with the one piece, you know and ask them to cast a wide net and then you hope that someone in that net if they don't have something that works for you they cast a wide net and that's what networking is its connecting people from different places to the mutual benefit of those two people that end up connecting in a new network and you're when you think about it, you're daunted by the fact that you don't see exactly how it might work.But that's really what networking is.Is that you don't know exactly how it's going to work you start the process and hope however it logically that something's going to come from it and lots of people do that.It's not a burden necessarily to the person that you first asked they don't have to do much work and the next person doesn't have to do a lot of work.Everyone does a little something.I know it's uncomfortable for you when you think out theBut they're not vouching for you.That's not that's not the question isn't can you get me a job the conversation is?Hey, I remember me we were together at blah blah blah if that's how far back do you need to go or stopped in?Just wanted to let you know I've been looking for a position in this field.Thought I'd let you know in case you knew of anything and then they get to take that where they want.They can say, it's sorry to hear you've been looking for a while.I don't know any of anything or they can say.Oh, I don't know but my friend is friends with whoever I'll drop her an email.That's not a lot of effort for that person to makeOr oh, I saw on my Twitter feed that such and such as hiring.You know, they may not have to do much more than that.Yeah, so let's add that to your list one application this week.And the least scary networking thing.Send the least scary email and it doesn't you don't need to bake for a job.You want to start at 3 interdict reintroduction?Think about it as a reconnecting and just letting people know you're out there.You're out there looking you're not asking them to do a specific thing for you.You're not expecting a particular response.You're making obscene and letting them know you're looking so that and think about who might be possible and it's absolutely fine to start with the least scary person that the barred owlIs that doable or is that too much?I have faith in you.Okay.Okay, that seems fair.So either one job and the least scary or least scary and Tack on another.Yeah, I mean it will probably be a very similar email just changing the name.Yeah.Right, but I mean the the hardest part to let him know you've been looking is probably the harder part 2 craft and the hello.So and so so I have faith in you you can do scary things.If you can get through panic attacks, which we know you can you can do this toI will see you next week at the regular time.Actually got back they needed an extra code that they don't usually need so I resubmitted it with an additional code.So we're back to Starting Over Again.Let's hope that it's not but it might be.But it's not a denial.It was just a like.Hey, we need a little more information to process this.Yeah.So you've been having a rough time?Is that how you feel?So what do you think now?And you're not panicking?What do you think about hurting yourself?So it must be pretty scary for him to listen to.Are you sure that he knows that you're not going to do it?Are you sure you know that you're not going to do it?He was concerned.So I guess I'm curious about him.What it does for you to talk about it because it sounds like you feel certain even when you're in those moments that although you want the pain to stop that.You're not actually going to hurt yourself.So I'm wondering what does it do to talk about it.Does that make it better?Does that make it worse?You've been week.What would that be?What do you want him to do?What do you want his response to be?And it sounds like you don't actually want to.Would it be okay with you?Do you think it's okay to hurt yourself?So there's the problem.Hurting yourself is hurtful.Those are all risks.The other problem with you cutting or hurting yourself in any other way is that it doesn't stop the problem.There isn't somebody who cuts once and never feels to panic again or the depression or the status again without working through whatever it is.That's creating Panic.They're not effective treatment.You might maybe somebody feels distraction a relief in the moment, but it doesn't do anything to prevent the next panic attack or his change the external situation that might be creating a stress.It just adds another problem and one that's potentially difficult to manage the risk.I know you're having a lot of panic and it's really uncomfortable.But I don't know how adding another issue on top of that is going to make you feel better.That's true.You seem to be having a lot of trouble finding something in that will Elevate what's going on?But it's not so it's not having a negative fat, but it's not having a positive effect either.almost everydayhow many panic attacks are you having in a day?So whenever you're not occupied.your mind or your body or can I canAnd you could do it.Were you can I can while you're doing that or the panics would have some side of it while you were active?That's unusual.How did you manage to do that?How did you focus your thoughts enough to be able to make good decisions and drive safely?It seems like that ability.You have to be able to somehow Focus your thoughts on what you need to focus on can be used because once you the more usually the more you get engaged with something Panic subsides enough so that you're not so that it doesn't feel like a panic attack right when you said like you're having a panic attack before rehearsal.You didn't during rehearsal.You were engaged and not focused enough in what you were doing that the anxiety was reduced enough so that it wasn't bothering you.And you get absorbed in it.It seems like you we need to find ways for you to be more absorbed more often during the day.I wonder if part of what's happening is that there's not enough of your day right now is taken up by things that feel productive but feeling gauging I don't think you're satisfied and that space that empty space you have is being filled by Panic.Are there other things you can do?Can you volunteer more?Can you schedule outings with friends so that you're not staying home?I noticed you were wearing dressy or clothes than usual.If you even panicked.Are there spots that trigger the panic?I know what that starts you say.You just kind of think I'm panicking and panicking, but I wonder if you noticed what happens just before you notice the panic.And it feels really out of your control.I can hear that.Oh, no, not again and it feels like there's nothing that you can do to correct it or moderate it at all.So you don't feel like the Klonopin helped at all.Usually people feel in effect in about 20 minutes.And usually a panic attack is over with in 20 minutes typically.It's been a really rough couple of weeks.What's been going on in Sydney?Has he been doing the past few weeks?So you kind of flip-flopped a bit and he's been doing a little bit better and he's been doing a little bit worse.Do you think there's any connection?You know, you're often the strong one for him.So I wonder if now that he's doing better.You know, you're often the strong one for him.So, I wonder if now that he's doing better.You don't have to be a strong he relies on you a lot when he's not feeling well.But your guard down a bit and it takes over.I don't know if there's a connection but I guess you guys spend a lot of time together.You guys are very closely connected and I wonder if it almost works as a system rather than complete independence of one another.I wonder if you can find a way where you could both do really well.Yeah, well, I think that would be a big would certainly relieved One external stressor.That would feel nice to be able to say some of the things you can hold them back.Carrying around that guilt probably does weigh on you.So there's a lot that would change if this works out.Was there anything you could write a cover letter for this week?so that got in the way of even being able toThis is true.But since I have you here today, I thought I'd ask.Yeah, I think that the job postings will probably slow down later this month when the world shuts down for Christmas or at least this part of the world.So using that while you can, you know, when people might still be putting in their postings up earlier in the month try to take advantage of that.Try to focus your mind on things that you can do rather than letting it be filled by whatever pops up which right now and it's empty.The thing that pops up is not feeling good.We did lots of cognitive.So the behavioral piece of cognitive-behavioral is some of the actions that I encourage you to take things like scheduling and walks creating a structure in your day and some of the breathing exercises and relaxation exercises.We tried I know we did some last time.I'd like to try some again today.Those are some of the behaviors that often work to manage anxiety symptoms and the cognitive piece when people say cognitive behavioral therapy are things like when I ask you to try to come up with an alternative way to think about something to challenge some of the beliefs and assumptions that you makeYeah, and so positive behavioral therapy is what most people recommend for anxiety because it works for lots of people to manage.Sometimes you struggle against it, but I keep sneaking it in there and I hope that at some point it will take hold for you and that you'll be able to get use out of it, but they're hard for you.What do you think it is that makes those Concepts really hard for you to sort of grass.cakeWould you rather be right or comfortable if you had to pick one?But you don't.But you're not skeptical of your own beliefs.Because for some people what's useful is not necessarily the leading another thing but believing that there are other possibilities.That's true skepticism that there isn't there isn't necessarily one.Right but that there are lots of ways to look at something or lots of possibilities and we're uncertain that there's some level of uncertainty in any of the beliefs and sometimes that you're not necessarily choosing a different belief, but you're just choosing to believe that there may be some wiggle room or an error in anyone believe.It's people freedom to just feel more comfortable and if you want to comfort sometimes that helpsLike part of you wants to be comfortable right now, but right now it's more important to be right.What do you mean by that?Does anxiety lie in the same way?How made it?Yeah, I think I'm going to greet with you that.Yeah, I think I would agree with you there that those do feel like anxiety lies.So what is your truth?So if those are anxiety lies and depression lies will call them.What is the truth on the other side of that?I'm so when you did ask about cognitive behavioral therapy The Next Step there.So one step would be is what you just did for me.This is the anxiety lie.And here's another way to think about it.Maybe the anxiety feels really horrible right now, but it wouldn't be better to die.That's an alternative relief and you just came up with it.The next piece is to look at what you said next was doing all these things and it's not working and I'm really frustrated making that so that's very kind of absolute.It's not working making that a little less absolute doing all the responsible things that I'm supposed to be doing and you're not working and just adding right now.It doesn't make it untrue, right?It's not working right now.That's very true.But what it does, do you said makes you feel a little bit like a little bit less like it will never ever ever ever work when you say it's not working.Could go on you could assume in there.It's not working.It's never going to work not working forever.And if you just add staying in the present, it's not working right now that actually takes a little bit of intensity off because itMakes it a little bit less overwhelming to think that you're going to be stuck in this particular situation.Robber is unbearable to think that you're going to be stuck in a horrible situation for a limited time is still totally uncool, but it's less than bearable.We can usually bear tribe tragedy or intense discomfort for a limited time.You actually you were doing some of the steps of the cognitive work that helps and just pushing yourself to take that next step making it present centered rather than letting your thoughts be about the future Beyond that's part of what makes it so overwhelming.It's when you think it's going to be forever.Yeah, so it's not working perfectly, you know probably close to perfectly but it does seem but something has changed and so letting yourself see those little pieces rather than it being All or Nothing rather than it's not working at all.Well, it does seem to be delaying the Panic making yourself recognize different shades of grey.sometimesRight.Maybe you don't notice a difference.Absolutely.What we need to do is keep working until it's different enough.That it's more recognizable.I believe I sent your file.The one you signed here is a to a release.So she may want you to have one for her records, but you're technically covered.And you know, I'm happy that I talked more with her but you do I think you do an excellent job staying on communication with both of us.A lot of times people are unsure about what they're supposed to take or how much but you're very careful about that.It's good to have the release so we can communicate if needed but what you doing a good follow up with her, it's not a sound of Siri for me to hear her.Say the exact same thing.Yeah, give her an update of what's Happening.You followed the steps that she's outlined us far and let her know how it's affecting you but it seems to be pushing them off a little bit Delana maybe but that you're still really suffering.Oh, no.Yeah, what's the plan from now till then is it that your time will help more on a lower dose of Wellbutrin?Well, then that's why you're checking with her to see whatPanic is exhausting your body goes through a lot to get to that intense feeling.It's really disruptive when you think of panicking.How long does it take you to get back to sleep?You don't have a lot of control when you're sleeping and it's very disruptive to be broken without anxiety.And you don't generally have trouble falling asleep.Well, let's see if we can't find other ways to kind of lower the general anxiety Baseline.Your Baseline of anxiety right now is really high.Your panic attacks are lasting longer than typical panic attacks.That's really high generalized anxiety.And I think if we can lower that your sleep will return to what your typical sleep is like.It's a cycle absolutely being sleep deprived makes you more prone to anxiety.But you do have the ability if you wake up at night to sleep longer during the day to kind of catch up from that and rather than adding another medication to the mix.We're already making a lot of Med changes.Well, you can certainly ask your psychiatrist about it and see what her thoughts are.She would know best how it fits into the overall plan.Let's take a few minutes to practice that deep breathing and muscle relaxation again and see if we can't get that working for you and then regular appointment on Monday.Okay, so close your eyes so you can tune in to what your body is feeling and let yourself just follow a natural rhythm with your breathing getting your body mentally and just taking notice of what your body feels like noticing any places that feel tight and tense anything that feels uncomfortable but yourself shift, however, you need to to relax those spaces.And then as you let yourself get more comfortable, but yourself extend your breath so that you're taking slightly longer Fuller inhales and exhales.I want you to try something called time to breathing.You're going to work your own time.What you're going to do is as you inhale do a razor inhale and just count to four as you do it.And then after you've taken a full inhale before you're going to hold your breath for four and then you going to Exhale for 4.So work at your own pace to get into that rhythm.inhaling for 4 and holding for 4and exhaling for 4.Repeat that cycle a few times.inhaling for 4holding for 4exhaling for 4as you're comfortable doing that you can scan your body again noticing any places where it might feel different than it felt before no need to judge the feelings.No need to judge if it's the same or different just noticing it.And now just let yourself return to normal breath inhales and exhales at whatever Pace feels natural to you.And then let yourself return to the room like over your focus.That was different than what we've done before.What was that like for you?Don't judge it.It is what it is.Well, so it's probably not right.It's probably because you've done with singing you do breathwork whether you're focusing on breathwork or not, right?It just happens to be saying so it's probably the Odyssey feeling is probably not about the air, but you felt it.So it means something.So maybe it's just uncomfortable for you.So it's not dangerous, you know, you can breathe for a count of four.You've held a note longer than that.So it's not about whether you really have enough air, but something about focusing on it felt different to help dizzy.That doesn't have to be a bad feeling.a long.Of timesomething about stopping and holding it felt different.And part of doing an exercise like that is that you want to feel something different.So when you're in the middle of a panic attack where you might be reading and lots and lots and lots of oxygen doing something different can be enough to shift it.So it's not necessarily that you're looking to feel something in particular when you're panicking.You just want to feel something different.So you might so now I've introduced you to two types of relaxation exercises the last time we did a little bit of deep breathing and then a very muscle focused one and they just show something different because I want to give you options and you know, try it out.You can try it when you're not panicking, but when you are panicking and know that you're safe.You know if you're sitting in a chair.Answer to be a little bit busy.It's a different feeling but that's not a dangerous feeling to you.And it sometimes people feel dizzy because they're paying so much attention to their breath in a way that they're not used to paying attention to it.And that's why I only had you do it for a few minutes.You don't want to do it for an hour because send it with the overwhelming.So like I think I had you count or five Cycles maybe and then let yourself return to normal and it might be just enough to move you out of where you are two different place.Okay.I will see you on Monday.Yeah regular time.Yeah, they're doing some painting probably the next time it'll be the new furniture.Yes, so painting furniture andrugsOh, congratulations.How did it go?That's a milestone.Well, I was going to say you thought it was important you're thinking it's important to talk about it is different than my finding it interesting.I mean there's a relationship butwell one is about me and the other would be more about you and what you need.No, the other thoughts are related because one of it is about me figuring out what's important and the other is your feeling that something is important.Is it a matter of how much of your experience do you feel should be private or not?Yeah, I'm just trying to pursue it out.It seems like a lots coming up so far in the session.So I'm just trying to sort of parse it out.But it's noticeable.Okay.Right in that way.And when you stay this way for the rest of my life, can you be more kind of flush that out of it?Do you feel that in addition to their not being more than Tanya's depression in your marriage you feel that's true for Tanya as a person to that that much of her life right now.Do you feel trapped in any way?Do you know we talked about this a little bit before but do you know what you'd like to do next?Do you and Tanya talk about this?What would make you feel less trapped in your marriage with Tanya?But that's not what mately what makes you feel trapped because you're trapped by your sense of obligation.I mean if it was going on if Tanya didn't have the problems she's having the question wouldn't even come up and so you would feel trapped but given that this is a situation.And the training part is it that you get little of what you need or is it that being around that sort of mood or atmosphere brings you down?Really?Well, what's so that means there's more than one answer to the question.So what are the different answers?Well, it's something that you want in a relationship.So it seems like that's a good.and you feel like that's part of the concern that some of the things that you might be looking for aren't sort of realistic orAnd you felt like that's not present in Tanya.Does she have future plans for herself?I have a couple of different kinds of thoughts.My first thought was getting back to something that you said early in the session where you said I thought this would be interesting to you and I was thinking about15 till 2 orientation.It is toward another person in this case me.And not about I really want to talk about this sort of like almost and I understand there is they're not completely untied but it's not about you and what you want and what you need in your session and what you're going to talk about today.It's like you being here for me rather than meeting here for you.Yeah, I understand that.I certainly don't experience the totality of our sessions like that.But there's something in you that feels that way and I am actually related to Tanya and I can get you a lot of things.Right, right.Yeah, right.I meant it that way.That's what I thought.I'm sorry.What were you?Well the thought I had which certainly you know can relate to Tanya.Although not necessarily produced by the situation is like sort of what makes people want other people to stick around.The idea of your saying things that interest me is maybe a way I would want you to stay around.People who try to alienate people in their life in general for complicated motivations will probably come and try to alienate me, too.It's probably hard for you to imagineI would imagine.But you were that was en route to your saying something else.wellWell, there's a right.So there's the Counterpoint to wanted to interest me, which is alienate me, but then there's also the it's just not a it's not a concern so it doesn't come up.No, it's that.It's not a concern.It's felt like to be a given.So that it wouldn't be something that you would need to sort of have on your mind and work towards.It would be a given.Yeah.And then the question is which I think.Which is I think a big question, but you know, why not?This week.I'm realizing we need to stop and we definitely have to come back to this.I think it's because it's so important.So the next few Wednesdays are holidays.Are you awake for I'm here.So I'm happy to reschedule if you were here or else.rightRight, so I'm not.Right, so I'm not here on those Wednesdays, but I am here the other days.So I'm happy to reschedule.I have time on Thursday the 2nd.But see I have a I could do 12:45 you want to do that?So, let's see do not next week and then the following week rather than the first I'll see you on the 2nd at 12:45.And then we'll go back to Wednesdays.Okay, great.Okay.Take care.Have a good Christmas.Okay.Okay.Take care.Hi.How are you?What do?Are you looking for someone to replace you too?Why?I see.That's true.You're not sure.You're not sure.Because you're feeling especially insecure.That's quite a change.Well, it's also the reason you seek him out.So can you say the dream again?diffuse the explosionAnd what were like what was the explosion was like in a box?Do you remember those?What was the feeling in the dream?What was your relationship with the actor?What do you make of it?That's interesting.That's what comes to mind.knitting DavidI mean, it sounds like the dream with a sort of sexual relationship with that actor came after.So the flying came first?What did it feel like?The fly, what did it feel like?So you were flying and you were invisible or you were just high up?You were visible.Did you feel free?This was this is a very Cecilia piece thing to say you startle operating on it.You have an idea and then you stop and then you ask me.weather freedom and anxiety to go togetherWhat you make of looking for pictures free?So there was a confusion of time in the dream, too.In that piece anyway.Do you think that's the relationship with Victor to that this sort of kind of love like comfort thing you're feeling.That this sort of kind of love like comfort thing you're looking for.It feels like a younger your younger self to.Well, I was coming on the non-sexual piece.I was thinking you were struck by the fact that it didn't feel like a sexual relationship almost like a friend or even the parents like just that comfort.I'm so you associate it to be 10 when the actor was age.He was so I wondering if you and the dream.We're sort of a younger person looking for something Comfort or love.How would that happen that you would ruin your dreams?What do you think the explosives represented?Things are not what they seem.You see it, but you can't shine.So there's an anxiety about having a freedom.What do you do with open space?You know the feeling we're going to need to stop for today.So I will see you next Wednesday and next Friday.Okay, and that will give us one.Oh, thank you very much.Same to you.Take care.Bye.Hi, come on in.Good morning.Were there particular vows that were especially hard to hear?What are you thinking about?It's been that long since we've been here.Do you feel like they just you're not on their radar they don't get it or do you feel like there's sort of actively trying to avoid something?Well, it sounds like you didn't go with me explicit expectations.You are deeply unhappy and deeply angry about your situation.Yeah, sure seems that way to me.on her partWell, I wonder where you going to say something.And that confuse me for the moment because it sounds like at least some important features of her you feel are still there.So when you said you can't address it because it was in the past.Iyeah.It's interesting because it was sort of related to that.There's one piece of dealing with Tanya's illness in the present and then also in the past which is sort of a traumatic event for lack of a better term that you went through that you feel completely alone in and you can't share with her because she was there and not there at the same time or yeah, I guess that's one way of putting it but when you were talking just a moment ago and in terms of control and responsibility, I was thinking that I sounded like to meet one of the conflicts that you're experiencing is being married to someone who you were worried as a sort of fundamentally different personal and moral ethics than you which is not about the ACT.It's not even about her illness.Yes.Well, this is certainly not the only solution or it's not the whole solution.But this kind of thing.I think you can have conversations with Tanya about.and handle meaningI can't answer that on a practical level.But it seems like ultimately an untenable way to live your life.On a very basic level you can't control for all the factors that will upset her and I appreciate your saying well these speaking is upsetting her so I can choose not to speak which is different than other things which seem more out of your control.But I think it's a general approach in your marriage.It's untenable on it.So many levels not the least of which is the pent-up anger will just continue to grow.Well, when one feels really really angry at the person or people they love being worried about the impact of that anger.I think it's a general fear.I mean, I think that's kind of a sphere in general that you might have regardless of onions psychological state.And then it's exacerbated by it.Well, they can do one of two things they can keep inside or they can express it.Or maybe the question was more complicated than that.Probably it was because that's what about bs.What are you thinking?But you can't know.That's so much as a scientist.That's that's a terrible analogy.You can project was far more accuracy than the other by.So that's what's wrong with the argument because you can't know you can have a fantasy that you can know.I understand your prediction is not 50/50 random.Yes, but you still can't know but you certainly feel that your anger can be destructive.Well, then maybe I'm not giving you enough credit so far as not knowing what you feel she can and can't handle.Well James, we're actually going.That we're going to need to end on that note.I was going to say or I'm going to say, you know, I'm happy to meet with you if you wanted to do twice a week for a while.We can really just get into it and we are into it.You've got a lot to figure out there sometime constraint sounds like in terms of your job and figuring that out.So I just want to put that out there to you that I'd be happy to do it.I think it'd be helpful not to say that meeting once a week isn't helpful.Okay.I'll see you next week then.Okay, you take care.Well, what's happening?Why?It's a good thing that I get the movie reference because whenever I find whenever I use movie reference in classes, all of mine are from the 90s and the 80s.So that's pretty I got that one.That's my jonra.I can see it what's been happening?Well, we were talking a lot.I mean you kind of surprisingly told me that you had a discussion with your wife and you talked a bit about being unhappy and she acknowledged that but then it was kind of dropped.I also remember that she had an opportunity to continue the conversation when you went to go see your kid at Indiana University, right and she chose drive with a friend instead.And so I think that's where we were.And was it just you?Okay, I'm not familiar and I'm a musical.I love musicals.Interesting, okay.Tell me about it.It's like a punch to the gut.What physical reactions are you having?It's all the anger.You've been holding back for a long time.That's amazing and very powerful.Wow is right.So what not only enables you to do that, but what enables you to do that and then what reaction did you get?What reaction did you get?Oh, yes sure.That made it much worse.I can see that.yes, well, it's patronizing you go do your job and you just get that fixed with your little counseling program over there, and when you're all fixed come back and we'll go back to The Way We Wereyou and sheIt was deeply honest.rightand Lisa gets the emotional intimacy that you're missing.Give me some verbage.And how did you react to her sentence?You said it the station for some very good reasons?Go ahead.Even out of sequence.It's okay.Good for you.Emotional honesty, it's not junk Sheamus.It's not junk.It's a truth that's always been there that she has ignored because it was convenient and you've been trying to ignore so you didn't have to have the conversation.So although I imagine it's a deeply painful space.It's a cathartic space because this is all the stuff that you've been holding it in and it's in some ways.It's unfair that you are the one who has to hold it in and she lives from the benefits of your holding it and you shouldn't have to hold it anymore because you're not asking for anything unreasonable.But it needed to happen.I know you know why?Well, not only that but you guys met around music music is white.Sometimes pulls her away from me.Sometimes pulls her away from you.I mean, IYes, I mean and so and whenever you are forced to connect it's forced to connect instead of wanting it's around music or her concerts or her deciding what you're going to do so I get it.So you said to her I'm not going to put up with this anymore.And how what did she how did she respond to that?Did you take any of that kind of guilt inducing statement into yourself?Because that's not actually what I'm hearing that you said that maybe what she heard you're stating your own needs and she's received it.Yes.Okay, good good.Well, okay, but this is a two-person issue.Sure, but you're not.Yes and my guess is there were times in the marriage you did try to talk about your feelings and you were shut down and maybe her as well.That's usually what happened.Somebody teaches you how receptive they are to what you think and feel but you're not able to do that anymore and you're not asking anything unreasonable.What is a call and emotional intimacy?That's one of the reasons why people get married and have romantic relationships in the first place those two things.So this isn't anything that's unreasonable.It's a game-changer right?Because you're married kind of in name only and she's okay with that because she's getting her emotional needs met elsewhere, but you're not okay with it anymore.I mean, I'm very proud of you, even though I recognize that it said deeply painful experience, but it almost needed to happen because you're not good at being honest with you.You're not good at being honest with you you can do it, butYes, but it's taken its toll.Yes and what you're asking the complement that's missed is I want to be close to you.That's not what she heard but in some ways.Well, I and I hear what you're saying, but the idea that I want intimacy and this is your expectation.I don't know if you guys can do that or have that given all the damage that's been done.I don't know what that you can't have it but I don't know and I don't know if that's what you're seeking from her but stating that expectation there still an inherent complement and it is this is what I've been looking for.This is what I need.Tell me what the image means to you.I can see that it's painful for you.Can you tell me what you're feeling right now as you're telling me about it?having to hide eventhe five-year-oldSo you saved you comforted you hugs you?It's almost like and part of my interpretation if it's not correct, but it's almost like I'm kind of walking with you through this image, but I imagine for the first time in being honest about your feelings.Not only do you validate them, but you comforted yourself.So in some ways you provide the intimacy that you needed because you believe that your feelings are true honest and valid and before you had been dismissing them.How did that go?Tell me about the pieces.Well, it's almost like you've been multiple ashamed in multiple areas.So the penis is a symbol of manhood that for you is a source of Shame men.I was just having this conversation with my husband and this is what makes me crazy about our society how we how boys don't feel nana be a man which I think are the most destructive messages.You can give another human don't feel and if you feel you're weak or vulnerable and on so many levels.You've been told don't be don't be don't be you don't feel and in some ways.That's not even who you are.And so I'm doing all this damaging messages takes a long time.Well, damn, I mean you some amazing work in a short amount of time.It's paperwork, but forNo, you're not.It can either be painful ending or a new beginning or both.What's it go ahead?Sorry.physical intimacyyelling at you physicallyAnd then and then what?Sure, because she's coming from her own place of fear.But again, it's unfortunate that she's not hearing what you're saying because for her it's about you're going to ask me to do something that I don't want to do and what it's certainly not unreasonable that married people have sex regardless of whatever age across the lifespan.Yes, but it's most married couples have sex.Well, but research shows differently.Yes, but she's not be able to hear the emotional intimate piece physical intimacy is an outgrowth of the emotional intimacy typically in a marriage, right?What was it like for you to kind of say these things to her and then get yelled at or not be heard.Yes, I almost hear that your needs were diminished.Like if you just want sex you go out and find it not just sex and sex is actually pretty important.sexuallyHow do you think that having sort of the physical deformity and her cutting off sex 7 years ago?Yes, how do you think those things kind of have impacted you?Even though that's not true.Sure.Are you familiar with the narrative therapy at all?You changed your narrative.We're in an alternate story hear you change the dominant narrative.Yes, well the diamond tip.The dominant narrative is what we've been looking at this whole time all these messages of inadequacy these messages about your worth and keeping your feelings but you as of last week or two weeks ago now just change the narrative completely like I don't want that anymore.We've been talking about the old scripts and how they weren't true and how your kind of really talented man who can pick up and do all three careers and do them well and how you're sort of a very deeply feeling man, even though.It's been told you've been told that's not okay.And you got rid of that negative narrative.It's brought you to a painful place but a very honest place and a place where so I'm hearing her kind of saying these things and diminishing your needs, but I'm also hearing that you did not take that in and say, you know what?You're right.Maybe I should but you would haveThat's how we know that the narrative has changed.You would have gone.Okay, you're right.Maybe I shouldn't want sex which is insane.It's insane.Well, same thing hurt is if your expectations were unreasonable, but they're not unreasonable their normal healthy expectations or a marriage.Sure, exactly.Exactly.And I mean, yes, it's her own Terror and things like this.I get that and have a lot of experience working with individuals of sexual abuse.I get that but the fact that it's a surprise that you need these things is troubling.No, she's surprised that you are saying you need these things.Okay.Can you take me back then before the kind of 7 year absence.Past the beginning part of the relationship you had three kids.You've had to have sex to have three kids.Yes, exactly.Yes at least three times.But so how was this what was being conveyed in your marriage?Let's say 15 years ago actually about sex.So sex was always an issue.And always the message was you always want sex.You always want sex.Wow, that's a pretty loaded message.You know what it says.You're not supposed to want this from me what's wrong with you that you want me to have sex your depraved or whatever, which is completely not the case.And then was it awkward or was it always initiated by you?And how is sex after the medicated state?Well, no wonder you stop having sex if you could told that something's wrong with you basically, or why can't you just love me for who?I am pretty soon.You're like it's not worth it.You know what?I wonder sorry to interrupt you.It's almost like and obviously I don't know your wife, but it's almost like you know what their real fear might be about for her finding out.There's something wrong with her.Yes, right.And soYes.Well, so instead I say there's something wrong with you.There's something wrong with your expectation, but deep down.I wonder because I don't know.I think it's pretty common knowledge or maybe because I teach the human sexuality class but most married couples have sex around once a week younger married couples have sex more middle-aged couples usually has sex about one time a week.This is not anything that's unexpected out of the norm.It's really not and so I wonder if the fear is you're asking me to give you something.I can't give you I'm not capable out what's wrong with me.So it's just a lot easier to say what's wrong with you that you even want this.Well, of course he would I mean it's a healthy knead absolutely normal.Nothing wrong with it.It's the expectation that you would be having sex with your wife.What does of course sex is the smallest piece of this?This is not about sex sex is just a way to communicate emotional intimacy.And if you could tell her right now what the point is in a sentence, what would be your point?But would you want her to know?How would you define intimacy to her?But in some ways you did by putting your feelings out there and by being honest even through anger, right?So you go from a place of not expressing your feelings to expressing your true feelings.Whatever they are in some ways he did.I mean, that's the amazing part about this.I'm not throwing that word around because I like it.I mean, it's amazing what you did after years of feeling stuck and silence and not being able to do this.You were dead honest unflinchingly about how you feel and what you want despite the fact that you've been told for so long that that's not okay some part of you doesn't believe that and you put it out there making yourself vulnerable and then refusing to take in any guilt about it or refusing to take in and this was not unkind.This is just really honest refusing to kind of continue in this place of being stuck.You're certainly not stuck anymore.well what do you think about this idea being thrown in your face of just go and find someone if that's important to youShe meant sexually though.No, and I'm not suggesting or encouraging you to do that.But I'm saying what do you think about her throwing that out you what did you do with that piece?That's why I was concerned about it was designed that comment was designed to minimize your sexual needs and to make you feel cheap, but it shouldn't.Sure.Sure.So where does all of this leave you it's a lot?Sure, and you did?Good for you.How did that feel?No.Right, right.Well and that's okay.You did it to get yes.What would it be like for you to not go to choir practice anymore?it what itI can see physically.It's like this early.pissedAnd do you know why you're so pissed?I mean, I think I get it, but do you know why?Yes, well, it's so intimacy.It's like putting a Band-Aid over a gunshot wound.So you're going to make me breakfast now?Sure sure, and it's still another representation of the fact that she doesn't even get what you're asking.Like if I just come home from choir practice and make you breakfast, then we'll be okay and we can go back to what we were but you weren't going back that's not possible and it's not about breakfast right maybe a decade ago.It might have been about breakfast and talking over breakfast, but we're far beyond that point.It's in some ways.I would imagine it minimizes what you feel.Good for you.Yes, because you can't live with the dishonesty anymore.I'd that's dishonest.You cannot live with the hypocrisy anymore.And there it is looking you in the face.I hear that.Who else can you talk to you about all of these things?Okay, that might not be a bad thing.very raw right nowSheamus I don't think you're going to hurt anybody else.I don't think you need to worry about hurting other people, but you might think of other people even people who you might not have known long maybe even students in the program who you have a connection withUse your network.Probably less.So with some of the students in the program given.They're in the same place.You can share a piece with a person and a piece with and that's one of the things I typically find with students in the program with students who support other students typically really good at doing that but you were processing this so you're in the middle of it.Like I said, I'm really proud of you even though I know that this is a really painful place, but I also know I mean, I want you to think about how much the stick out of you.I mean, I want you I guess I want you to know how Brave you are.This is an act of Bravery because if we went back to and we can because they're all on tape earlier sessions, even my mentioning the idea of your anger.You said I can't go there.Even the idea of thinking about talking to your wife brought up all this anxiety and you just busted through that in such a short amount of time.Okay, it's been a long time coming.Well, if anything comes up and you need to talk, even though we're on spring break next week.If you send me an email, I'll call you and I don't offer if I don't mean it.So if you say and it's the best way to get in touch with me because the phones right there.So if you say can you give me a call?I'll say yes.What time do you have?I'll definitely give you a call.That's never a problem.so if you still need to process this or if something happens and you need toKind of explorer that please go ahead.And again, I will say I will never offer that if I don't mean it, so if you email me I will give you a call.Yes, I don't think you have to be afraid of it though.I don't know in some ways.I think you've made the decision not to waste another day.So you're not stuck?You've changed the course of what this could look like for you.I know some good ones.So let me know.Sure.Well, I the only person you need compassion for right now is yourself because you've not given you much compassion over the years.So right now I hope you are most compassionate with yourself.Yes, I don't see it that way.Not that I'm an expert on such things.But I guess if I thought that there was some unreasonable expectation then I'd say let's look at your expectations, but I hear a very normal healthy expectations for a marriage nothing that's not nobody's perfect, but wanting physical and emotional intimacy from and with your wife stating that as a need is absolutely normal.it doesn't sound ridiculous, butWell, I think you've been told for so long.So you will give me a call next week if you need to or send me an email and I'll give you a call right back.Please do.And I'm glad that we were able to get in today for sure.Let me know.We're back to our regular Tuesday time the week after next.Not next week, but the week after next.So some relief there.Yes, don't watch that movie now.No, I don't think you need to do that.Yes, well, I don't think we need the movie anymore.Maybeas long as you are honest and your feelings and in your words, whatever her behavior, if you find that objectionable, you can say why.And so then you will find her behavior less objectionable because you're being honest about why it triggers you.So so as long as you're honest in your feelings and your behavior,You have to stay with that because then you can be honest about why the cleaning is like nails on a chalkboard why that's not okay.And again, I think that's a pretty accurate accurate response not reasonable.Okay.Take care of yourself.And let me know let me know.No, it's I really enjoy working with you Seamus think of yourself as Brave incredibly Brave.Yes for sure for sure.No, The Lego Movie.Is that a modern movie?That's out because I am so out of touch with modern movies.Do I need to see that?Okay.I'll have to look that up.Okay.Take care.Alright.Bye.Bye.Hey, come on in.Thank you.Good morning.Does it feel like there were particular hard things that we keep getting too or does it just feel like lots of hard things come up?And does it feel like you talk about everything except Tanya because you want to make sure that you get a chance to talk about other things or do you feel like you're avoiding talking about Tanya?It depends on the type of answer you're looking for I don't mean to be intentionally invasive.I mean isYeah, I'm not I'm saying that and then I'm realizing I'm not actually sure that what the like if I had actually categorized this kind of answer.Is that kind of answer?You know, there's like the question of why do bad things happen to good people, right?Is a question answerable.Well, you can find you can create answers and mini boy answers to it.But their answers are not you know their type of answer.Right, you can certainly get to a description and you can certainly get to a system of meaning-making words answerable.I mean, it's well, I'm serious though, you know a lot of religions tackle this and they have a way to answer it.Yeah, so can you then tease out the percentage of biology and the percentage of environment?No, I mean, although I imagine that's not quite what you mean.I don't think you would know that you would think that way anyway.Right, so even gets this to the point of environment and maybe this gets to the difference between biology and environment people have horrible traumatic experience and are kind of okay in life and people have less horrible experiences and go through life like completely disorganized and miserable.I mean,Why does that happen?And maybe an important part maybe the important maybe the important point.I'm thinking as I'm talking in order to think in a sense is that I mean that maybe the point for you is that how can you make sense of it?It may not be the answer because there may not be the answer.But what kind of sounds can you make of it?And Tanya may make her own sense.You may have a shared sense, but you need to make sense of it to because it's your experience with her as your wife and your life, you know.What are you thinking about?I can see how troubled You Are by this I can see it and I can understand it to.Well, there's so many layers to it.There are at least two which is the feelings you have and then the implications to the feelings you have are possible application.I guess the implications part is the to do about it part and possibly somehow linked to that what you do about it.What does it mean for you?What does it mean to Tonya?What does it mean to your relationship?What does it mean about the future of your relationship expectations you had modifications and expectations possible modifications and expectations because how can you possibly know?You don't talk very fast.You're doing fine.I'm not itching to respond.Because you're feeling lost in this.Well, I think here's one of the difficulties.There's a lot of difficulties difficulties seems like such a generic word, but there's a feeling of like what has happened.How do you even make sense of that and work through it the sort of disappointment the pain and the anger and that's a piece of it the other piece of it maybe which is larger.I don't know is what are the implications for the future in your marriage?It's not simply just working out or try to work through something sort of terrible that has happened in your recent past but it's what does this mean for your future which is a really that's huge.And I feel like I started thinking about where your expectations come from.There are probably a lot of ways to think about this but I thought of three things in one particular kind of way of thinking about it.There are your hopes and dreams you could say or your hopes and dreams come from but let's put that aside for now.Your experience I expect this because in my experience it's happened before and promises that people makes you that you then expect them to fulfill.I'm so in all three areas.This has been awarded for you.Certainly.These are not part of your hopes.This was not part of your experience.Tanya was depressed in the past.But this level of depression was not part of your experience.And this has nothing this is the antithesis of what she promised you in terms of being your wife and being your partner.I would imagine responsibility would matter for most people and then I would also say in particular for you in addition to that it's your personal ethic in a very broad sense that.But it's also importantI mean you know I mean because she had something or she felt suicidal and what she did with that which is talk about it threatened it others would threaten it as you knowThere's actions about her that it hurt you it hurt her too, but it hurt you.I'm so you're wondering is she responsible for hurting you or could she not do anything about hurting you?and that mattersbut even saying that I get the sense, it's sort of like that's a pretty low bar.Like great.Okay, butI can understand that.Do you think she understands that she may need to do things to regain your trust?well, I would think that would be true for you toDo you think less so maybe not I don't want to speak prematurely.It's horrible that you have your limits.I know I was going to say let's talk about some expectations.You know what the human being is capable of let's talk about expectations.It did seem like when you said Tanya would have no idea what that would look like, but it sounded like you had more than no idea.Yeah, I was going to ask to feel like she's responsive to that when you ask her.do you feel that she understands that you're saying that not simply for her benefit, but for your benefit toThat's important.If she feels like you're just trying to be helpful to her then you know, she can sort of do what seems like it might be helpful to her but not about what you need which is which is different motivation.What's the how part?What's the moral piece?I can see where this is going to go this conversation, but she took actions that hurt her intent was not to hurt you but they hurt you just like the intent would not be to hurt her but they might hurt her.I'm not arguing you should do a tit-for-tat.I'm just simply.Really?Well, I would argue that what we're talking about with you.There's a more productive and goal.There's a more productive end the goal than with her what she did.It does make and especially when I think about what happened between her and this professor before you guys got married.It doesn't make me think very much in the model of helping a relationship heal in the face of infidelity.Not even that actually test.And when someone betrays your trust in a very deep way, we sort of Define infidelity like that.How do you help a relationship heal?And that's what we're talking about in terms of regaining her trust.And of course there was a previous infidelity which may not have even been probably wasn't as dramatic for you as this one.We're a matched amorphous structure of what we think of infidelity, but then there's thisWell, it's a betrayal of like sort of the very I mean, I guess you could sort of I don't know if you can frame a lot of things into betrayal of trust because that's what it's a very specific way.But there's certainly I guess there's ways in which people don't meet our expectations and then their expectations that seemed so foundational on basic that when those expectations are not met or worded.That's that's betrayal of trust like somewhere.There's some, you know Continuum, but I should think about it moreBut I'm not in a very practical way and I'm not saying it should be now, but I just think how you guys started with me.I think it would be helpful for the two of you to have a couples therapist.It wouldn't be me anymore, but we talked about this.The get-go in terms of we switched but you know, especially if I I think it would be helpful anyway, but then when I put it in the framework of regaining trust, which I really think couples need an outside party to do when there's been a violation of trust.I don't really maybe it's not possible.It seems close to impossible to heal on your own.I really do think you need the presence of a third-party.I mean a trained third-party but another to help with that.It seems so foundational to a relationship and we could talk and we could talk about practicat.And we could talk about practically if you want to do it when you want to do it when it would even make sense if Tanya was open to doing it again when that would be but I do think that would be an important piece probably in both of your healing processes.What are we thinking there?How do you mean?Yeah, I think I'm hopeful two couples in a lot of ways like be a lot of ways but certainly that in my opinion.That's one way in which I think it's virtually impossible for a couple to do it on their own.I think in most other ways it's very helpful to and maybe I don't know I have to think about it more maybe there's a lot of ways but then I think it's a virtually impossible but that in particular just comes to mind.and it has so many of the characteristics of infidelity because one question that when there'sAn affair is how do I know he won't do it again?and sois thereNot quite right.I mean there's definitely differences.It's not the exact same thing.There is a question.It's not quite like this though.There is definitely more assumed responsibility, you know, I think in the case of an affair, it seems more volitional potentially more volitional.But you have a much better vocabulary to describe it but it seems like there are responsibilities that are your worth because they're by definition in your control and there are responsibilities that may or may not be in your control at least from moment to Moment by signing up for them and make you an obligation to another person is still your responsibility even if moment-to-moment.It doesn't seem like they're in your control and those are still responsibilities.Well, it's good to be nice to people who you love.and you feel that way to her, but she feels sad, you know, you could find a lot of categories that don't fall under obligation, butActually not maybe before a little bit.I wasn't necessarily suggesting that.I was more so it's saying two kinds of categories of responsibility not represent us attorney for someone.Yeah, we're going to need to stop there for today.Because I'll see you next week.Okay.Take care.Good morning.But there's a difference between being oblivious to her mood and not attaching significance to it every day.I'm not encouraging obliterating categories and having everything be in the good category.My pleasure.How are you feeling that Tanya's are volatile or if they're just as volatile as they've always been.Well, I was asking just about your term of volatility.Unpredictable is usually the reference.You're looking intently.I don't know.It was just up to me whether I let us sit in silence.butwell, I'm curious about a lot of things butSometimes I like to sort of just see where your mind goes.What it seems like something is in your thoughts.What are you thinking?Oh, no.I see.I see.It's like who will speak first?Did you not like him or did you not want to be in couples counseling?badno, I feel bad because I know him less than I actually I have someone now.I don't know if you want to try someone else.There are a few people.I really want to refer you guys too, or just booked.I know him less.He came on the recommendation of someone.I really trust you can be very good.Just not a good match for you.I don't like what I'm hearing.I don't like that.It sounds like maybe this is you are concerned with something different than mine your it's sounding like there were two concerns one is that he wanted to talk about something that you guys didn't want to talk about particularly Tanya II the things that concerns me more and maybe this isn't even intended is that he was pushing for a particular answer that may not have been true.That's more concerning to me.I mean not to say that you should be forced to talk about things.You don't want to talk about but you certainly shouldn't feel that you can't be honest.That's why I feel bad because I referred you to someone and it didn't sound like he did right by you.Sorry, I'm late.Let me change the subject and ask you something trivial because otherwise I'm going to immediately forget about it which a scheduling question.Could you switch least for awhile to 9:15 from 8:30 on Wednesday?Okay.Alright.What's happened since last night?To do it or not to do it.Well, I'm aware that there are sort of practical considerations, but for the moment, let's put those aside and do business as usual as usual.Which will come back to them later today.But yeah, I imagine you're telling me now both of your safety and about what's on your mind.Well, I have some thoughts.The first is as usual.I think I don't doubt your at all the sort of I don't know pain and horror and feeling trapped in the fear that you felt started yesterday afternoon.I guess either except for being asleep that you felt until now at the same time.There are some things that are a little suspicious.You do seem to have a pretty syrup to have pretty Surly forgotten and I imagine maybe unconsciously gotten rid of how you felt.Let me for example on Friday other times too.But that was just the time we talked about it.So which was considered considered Peru, we better and also since the beginning of black Fleet Week, very cautiously and Berry where we're really hopeful.I don't think what's going on now is just what you are feeling like OSHA.I kind of crashed again.And so the hopes I had were dashed.I don't think this is just that that would semen seem reasonable to me, but I don't think that's what's going on.Actually that I think it's likely that you have kind of gotten rid of what that felt like all together.I mean this isn't like oh things are going a bit better.But now I've had a setback so I'm kind of feeling worse about things and not as hopeful or optimistic as I was I think this is like that's gone in the I don't know quite what to call it.Like the horror the depression isn't quite right suicide isn't quite right suicidality the phrase that occurs to me is like it is back with a vengeance I think and it has obliterated what came beforeYeah.Yeah, you may be punishing yourself for having felt it.I'm not saying that it's going to make you feel hopeful again.But I think the model you kind of have kind of have of it to the extent that you have a model at all in the weighted.It was kind of sounded to me last night.Was it almost like it was quite biological.Like, you know or that's not quite right like something that some like something like that though.We're once you're out of the environment of the hospital or whatever like basically would be more like this these things just come to you.There's no Rhyme or Reason.They undo whatever could possibly be done in only imaginal way to feel any better is to be dead.Like it's the plague.I mean you get to play cure.Fuck.Yeah, maybe like being a hospital bed and to get some fluids or something.But basically you get the plague.You're fucked your dad.Now, you're dead later.You're going to suffer in the meantime and that's it.There's nothing really to be done.My impression.Is that.That's what it felt like but again actually look at it.Look at what has happened.That's not really what it looks like.We don't know ultimately if the ECT is going to make a significant difference.I mean it was for a week and a half.It's seems pretty clear along with being in the hospital.I always makes a difference.So it's hard to tell from what's what and hard to know how often these will come back with ECT.We don't know but though they're uncertain but there is uncertainty uncertainty their butt and he have your conviction that there is no real possible help Everest.I mean when I say it is a littleI imagine you know what I mean.wherever this is something we've run into before the feeling of a kind of inevitable of mono and monolithic quality of to the depression, especially this suicidality in a way that emerges little later I likeOr not quite fitting like I guess there has been times where it's before where it's very much felt that way and we sort of look back at why what's happening there were actually clear precipitous.And it doesn't make the horror of feeling this way any better, but it does sort of contextualize it a little bit.I think this is I think this has that too.I think the context is probably like a kind of guilty and then full reaction to feeling better at least in part or being taken care of.You know, maybe now I'm clearly on a roll here.Maybe maybe you know, you said when we talked on the phone, but you you were talking about getting help and you said this was after you were start starting to feel a little bit better in the hospital anywhere.Like now I'm kind of kind of feel like I have to leave I feel a little better.I don't feel like I deserve it anymore.I feel guilty about getting now I should just be out of here.And you said that in kind of a self-conscious way of knowing that it was still perfectly reasonable for you to be in the hospital, but I think you were saying look I'm completely desperate I either don't care anymore.Somehow it's okay to get the help.And then after I sort of am a little sort of an some little amount away from that actually it wasn't a little mount.It was hard to remember feeling that way when you were out of it.But anyways point is once you're feeling well enough to possibly not need that anymore and made you feel guilty to haveAnd I don't know maybe this is a real reaction to that guilt.Maybe you do feel guilty for Ever Getting It you sort of suspend that for a while when things are awful.And then when you feel better or you go home and falls on you like a ton of bricks.And this sort of Thoroughly cruising way that obliterates your recollection of things ever in better, whatever help or optimism.You may have had however guarded or weary.And it is terrible terrible terrible.But what happened to you?That's also not to say that I know that you'll survive this.I don't I hope so, but I really I don't know.Yeah.I see.Do you almost feel that impulse to make it clear to me that it wasn't even there?How would you like to to explain it?I mean, this is a genuine question.I'm not trying to set you up.I really want to know.Like you were probably taken in.And I'll probably taking it.Now you see it like it is.And I imagine you feel so sure.Well, what's the part about wanting to give up?It is almost like a u x that you were folded pulled into having hope and made things worse.Is like you don't know how you're going to bear it for the minute let alone for years to come.I mean, I don't mean to be in any way critical abuse Amos.I know you're working incredibly hard and that all this takes so much effort and takes so much out of the my thought at this moment is this is a little bit like when you saw a therapist as a kidAnd you were you were terrified that the therapist would find out that you were depressed and wanted to I guess talk about anything but and I kind of have a different assualt of a very different perspective on that which is that there is there was something very dangerous about the possibility of getting the help that you were sort of desperate to protect yourself.There's a way of that which I guess I sort of assumed before and I thought was that what you meant that you were afraid that if you were labeled depressed that somehow that wouldn't turn out well for you.First of all, a therapist clearly was not going to help second of all it would be something bad for you like your dad or your mom or whomever knowing this about you so it could only go badly.And I guess what I'm imagining now is maybe there was something something kind of more fundamental and sort of more terrifying about somebody someone finding out how you really felt what you really saw it and it was really like that you were being in a relationship with somebody who really knew those things about you was for some reason.I kind of got your possibilities, but I'm not sure which it is really dangerous.Yeah, so I mean to be clear I don't at all think you are sitting here like stinking all this stuff that you're consciously withholding from me.I don't have that and I think you've shared what comes to mind but I do think that unclog unconsciously.You're pretty in the head visit inhibited from thinking of things to say about what it's really like in a context.You're not generally at all lost for words or ways of talking thinking about or describing.So those things I imagine that might be whyIt's okay.I mean I imagine that the level of it probably makes you feel bad.We talked about that but you really wish like you probably feel like you're going to meet me at the service something before.And maybe go back through some of what I don't know where about you yourself in some other way.Maybe you're terrified and feel like no good could possibly come from having more to sayDo you ever want to do you ever want to feel what's going to happen?but safeYou just won't be able to things you want.And you won't care so much about whatever courage it takes, but how bad things are hurting?It will just be.Yep, I remember and you don't want to go back to the hospital.I'm not asking because it's going to be your decision.I'm asking because I at least consider taking into account what you want couldbut yeah, I mean if you were saying I would just feel so much better.If I was back there I would think about it, but you're at the moment saying you prefer prefer prefer.So obviously you're quite scared.and pretty helplessIs there any plan for the day?Yeah, and I have a question about the ECT and you may not remember this actually, do you know when it's about how full and now it is?Not at all the kind of assumed it helps kind of soon after the treatment itself or there was kind of aMore like it an SSRI where you would just sort of Build It Up over time, you know as opposed to like adderal.Will you kind of get a the Boost right away?Yeah.Mostly because it's hard to remember imagine that anything actually help.Yeah, I guess my inclination is to send you home and ask you to leave some kind of message a little later this afternoon to let me know where things are at.Obviously if you need to call me before that, you can but kind of at least let me know no late afternoon kind of where things are at and whether they're worse or the same or better.And then I mean we're scheduled tomorrow morning then you have treatment tomorrow.All right.Yeah, it's alright, you know my thought is just to kind of see what happens with that.But that actually makes a difference or not.What kind of go from there but obviously it seems get worse or get even more dangerous, you know.Do you have any other thoughts about the plan?Okay.All right will let me stop for now.Ramona just to let you know the Monday Memorial Day.I'm going to be out.Is the 27th.So two more weeks after this it will be three weeks from now.I'll take a week off.You're graduating.Is it around then that you're graduating?So we so we should take off the 20th.If you want to take a look next week as it gets closer.The reason turkey for me is that that week?I'm out Friday.So at the moment I'm pretty booked solid for the week.Going two and a half weeks.It could be okay for the time.If it makes any difference, I might have a time open a little bit earlier in the day.I don't know if that helps at all.I'm almost definitely going going to have a 120 time.Would that be better?Okay, so I'm going to put you down with?For them.Do you want to check on check on it and let me know?Where are you?Congratulations.Wow.Oh my God.Where is that at?And these are for research assistantship kind of positions.I don't.It's nice to feel that their irons in the fire in the possibility of things.How's things been with your senses with your sense of yourself you finish this exam?This is a big deal this transition, but I want to hear kind of wear.It's not that weird.That's why I ask because these other things can kind of cover-up and for the time being makes it feel like the external is going a little bit better.The long-term deeper work is still about your feelings about your own person regardless.The reason is why why is not surprising Ramona it is that you've gotten plenty of eggs in the past for example, and it doesn't touch this feeling it's not like, oh now I am a worthless person and that gets inside now,Meaning you stopped at one cabinet.You got one cabinet clean.It could be all so it could also be that you're human.You're a human being who gets tired and needs a predicate and some time to sleep more and some time to not do as many activities if it stays like that that's a different story.But I also never hear that you get to say to yourself.I get a break till I get a break today.When you say the end of the two-year agreement, what's the two-year agreement?and after thatWhat if you struggle the way Ivan has?It feels like those things and how you feel about yourself in this stage of your life and how you feel about him and listen since are so intertwined.It's like you are simultaneously imagine imagining this is going to make me feel this much more critical of myself as well as him.I was thinking the same thing about your quitting school, even though you talk about your childhood a lot of times it sounds like school and I may be projecting a little bit because you haven't said it in this level of detail, but I imagine you were going to school getting homework assignments coming home doing your homework.This is kind of been structuring in the Scaffolding in a way that's giving you a sense of yourself and feels like something that you can hang your hat on that makes you feel good enough about yourself is getting good grades meeting deadlines getting on top of things.To be at this turning point where you're imagining letting go of that as the scaffolding of your positive sense of yourself is terrifying.Who are you going to think?Who are you going to think of yourself?How are you going to think of yourself as an employee at a job where it's not these are grave.There will be evaluations of some kind at every job there are and it's but it's really really really quite different you felt good about yourself or about checking off boxes of school in some ways to me.This is an opportunity to get no to get to know more about what those feelings are underlying because they'll come out in a little bit more without the scaffolding.It's really it's a really interesting Association to because in a way you're saying that school is an environment where you have mostly gone to count on the authority figures doing what they're supposed to do.They might be better or worse at their job a little bit, but they're still going to show up.They have to teach the class.They have to grade your papers.They have to get their grades in or else they get in trouble, right?There's another Authority holding them accountable and that's been so reassuring to have adults in your life.Who do their job.He says that.It's a it's a way you feel like you have contact and connectedness with him.so who this is your father may be inside you what could this possibly feel like with her did he have expectations how did they play out as a kid expectations around job in school bus air pressure from your parentsWork you and your sister.You automatically did your work.We can take a bath.What happened?There's no Envy no part in your effort in your working really hard at something as kind of a Paramount thing and the great is really secondary.That's kind of how you feel.When I Ivan's parents are saying things like that to you.Like do they know who I am don't they know?I'm going to get a job and I'm going to do well.But I guess that's the thing you're describing.It's so assumed.I don't know how to describe this.It's almost like you don't get to get to Applause.If you do well at something it's just taken as a given expectation your mom saying well, of course.When you were younger you're saying.come on itWhat made it painful?So that's called culture immersion school and anglophone school.I don't think I've ever heard those terms before.I remember you telling me this story.So this was in which school?So this was the other school that your mother taught at.And you move there for your dad's job or you move there free or you move there for your dad's job.mythical horse with wingsWell, you're doing it now Under Fire.And in the immersion the immersion experience of having to do that.A less equipped than you'd like but defining the issue which is half the battle in understanding the issue making it clear to yourself.Sorry.Okay going to need to actually stop it in a moment.You we're about to say something though.I will see you next week.You're good.Yeah, I imagine parking around here would be.Also, I'm sorry about the bill.Good.That's nice.fromShe takes a lot of work.Yeah, yeah, I see.I see.What were you going to say?Here is that you're not sure it will be the right thing.Yeah, but I also imagine that you're quite worried that even if you feel like you're feeling like you're leaving a lot of high moral, you know, you know what I mean?Yeah.Are you sure that that's just the right thing you could say?I see.I don't think like an If you're sort of Blindsided the same way and you can look out for it and prepare yourself for it a little bit better.Things are getting really bad.These are your grandparents.I see.Do you have something else that your depression has a hand in that's not working out for the time being.Sure.What do you mean?I see.I never said you weren't.Yeah.Yeah.I think there's a lot of things that you learned about here and are sorts of things that can kind of help stop the buck, you know.Yeah, it does seem to me that you're sort of walking along the edge of a cliff here.And if you say the wrong thing or I say the wrong thing.It's just going to turn you off.Like you're the and the two had a better just to do it right and maybe to me to something by faster us is going to happen.As long as we're clear whom we're looking for out here.Is kind of accurate in the way or I mean representative Lee that you would be worried about what will happen to me and the pressure that's on me in the same way that in one of your Chief worries about things getting really bad against again as to James and how you would do and the two of you would do and where that would leave you.I see.You mean to you?Have you thought about?I see.I feel that a part of you is feeling really really bad.And that maybe we were talking about it as though things are okay, and you should go back there and your thoughts I guess about James are really in both places.I know.Yeah.You're getting pretty close to feeling that James and I would be better off without you.Well, that strikes me is pretty upset depressed.And feeling.When you feel that way you have your feelings are mixed around about having any way in that from him.It can be and taking care of you in a certain ways and the other having to worry about us about how you're doing.When were going to leave and that you're feeling you're not going to be able to put up with it.whateverBut you're going to stay it's going to be really hurt whether we that way or not.We should stop.Where shall we start today?Yeah, thank you for the email.I glanced at it and saw that it would require some work before we can.Yeah.Rely, whatever.Want some random advice on the bike riding thing.Return to learn much better.I mean Training Wheels.I mean not to actually teach them to ride without training wheel, but what actually does is a balance bike thing.Yeah, so instead try like if it's easy to get the pedals off the razor bike.So get the pedals and the training wheels off but the seat a little lower and then the regular bike is like a balance bike and they skipped longer and longer and on that and it's much shorter steps to actually being able to ride the bike actually like doing the training wheel bike doesn't have anything to do with better balance.So whatever.Sure.Yeah.Sure.Yeah, it's a new thing.I haven't an actual balance bike to be honest, but like the balance bike principles the bike store was going on about it.Lucky you.Like her name is Billa.hahaHow old was she when she died?where is such a storytelling family andWe tell pretty hard story as you know stories with a lot of bite, but nobody ever told stories about this girl.It became a sort of iconic for me.Like that was what people remember about me for years.I really like to ride my bike by myself.I really like to read didn't like putting down my book for anything.It was like in a parking lot.What's distract you in a way that recaptcha lights?I guess there's alsoabout not being with James because of feeling so sad that but I guess I also imagine that that wasn't the only thing that kept you apart.So my impulse is to try to cover that up and I act like I'm okay and then I get distant from him.Well, I guess you felt sort of the same thing and it's part of where we ended yesterday about talking with me about wanting to be dead and I must see it differently, but if maybe not for quite the same reasons, I think it's James you feel like I am in the position of seeing you kind of on your own with that.Feels like there is an estrangement there and it feels like an estrangement to myself to are you in strange from yourself to?I think you at least with me like set up the estrangement.I know what you mean yesterday my commitment giving me a lot of responsibility, I guess to do that.But at the same time we both know that I have very limited ability to do that.another way that requires on your participation andI guess I have the impression that there is some way then you kind of setup of it or experience it as an estrangement.Whereas you probably in part because it's so hard and so scary to talk about any of the really really awful dark sometimes self-destructive.Sometimes I think that you feel I think I think you're so worried and sometimes I or nobody else can bear to hear it.Then more will want to shove them back on you in some way or another, you know, like with having somebody die, you know, you didn't get to have the moment of discovering that we're figuring that out or like the horror of it or sadness or whatever.Like you very quickly made it about somehow being your fault for not knowing or your responsibility to deal with it or something like that.I think this is a real similar with some of the things like people can't hear those.I mean, it's not clear with James now and there are some ways he can or their limitations which are which are there?I mean that's not just you but I guess it seems like with me I also sort of anticipate that and even arranged it a little bit.Like the 10-minute like the minutes are like those are mine or if that's mine.I think that.I think I can sort of with you makes me neglectful and a seemingly benign well-intentioned like like make me seem benign and well-intentioned but actually neglectful, which I think you.Because it puts limits on how you feel how things actually are for you.On the basis of how I what I think that you should be like it doesn't make room for you.Does that make sense?inside a cast in a positive way, which I do so often do it people or change the subject or said something likeor said something and they meant be nice or they thought they were being helpful or I could see why they said it that way but really and left me alone and feeling worse.We're going to stop.Friday at 4:45Good morning.Good.Well, I mean.You know what?I mean?Yeah, I'm glad it worked out, but it's I guess I'm sorry you wanted to see me.Yeah.I see.AmandaDo you know where she is?Sounds like to me you're really quiet burden with a lot of things.And you don't want to have to deal with it and I think you're kind of angry with having to deal with it.But then very guilty about being angry about having to deal with it and I think Amanda / dress dresses you're coming to ferebee to talk about stuff.Yeah.Yeah, it's the yeah, or do you feel awful?Yeah, also sort of I really have to.Yeah, your schedules the same for the fall.Yeah, I'll see if I can arrange the Wednesday.I mean I've tried a couple times and maybe there'syeah, that's okay.No.Who is it?Okay.Somebody whose name you got from?Yeah.I'm trying to think of.To say how hard it is.I imagine if it feels like you should just learn to deal with how hard it is.You shouldn't have to lay it on somebody else by talking about how hard it is.I see.externallyextremelyI guess I it strikes me in different ways.Why don't think you're feeling a bit that way with me like.I don't want to fucking wear these clothes but like the way things are I don't like that.I don't want to be on top of everything.I don't like that.I want to quit and give up.I don't like that.I feel so burden Lake.And so I kind of imagined that there's something sort of historically revelance there where Selena has you and her parents to help her with that.She doesn't want to wear her clothes.We're going to sit there and we're going to get her to wear them somehow, but you'll help her you'll be more or less patient with her.You'll try different fix whatever and you'll see this.Is like okay.This is what a three-year-old does like.She's going through a phase like boohoo.We'll we'll try this will try that, you know some combination try and the straps are trying to force her trying to bribe her trying to do the laundry more and just losing patience with her.That's kind of like be with her and some extent.I don't know.I guess I can imagine that maybe you didn't have that.I guess part of where I'm a part of what I'm saying was I think it and I mean it sincerely by the way, but this it feels like you like such a large like kind of essential problem to not wanting to be doing these things.It's so burdensome and yet so dangerous to not do them.Answer like my complete vanity about it is that she won't feel that way because she's got you and her parents to help her feel like it's livable in like survive and it sucks, but it doesn't end the world.Guess what I'm saying isI think may feel like the end of the world.We should stop.Thank you teacher.Hi, come on in.Come in.You know what?I realized one quick matter on housekeeping so next week I give out statements.So we still haven't decided on what the fee was I was starting to make up the statement.We still haven't talked about that.That's fine.Normally I think I had said that I normally when people are working that's fine.We're meeting twice a week.And so I understand that's pretty costly 85 will be more than fine.Yeah, I'll email it to you.Yes.Yeah.Yeah.I usually just ask people to pay within a couple of weeks of state of the statements.Okay.We didn't see each other on Monday.Next Thursday, okay.I haven't seen you since then.Do you know why he wants to keep sort of the legal, you know, what's going legally from other things in your relationship?What sounds like he's really scared about the implications of this happening in your relationship, and he doesn't know what to do with it.Movie says, you know this isn't normal.This doesn't happen in most relationships.How do you feel?Is he feeling depressed now?Does he want to see a therapist down there?It sounds like both with your mom and your boyfriend there are similar frustrations, but their actions are not cord coordinating on concurrent with what they're saying.What sounded like what happened scared him and it's simply didn't scare him in terms of you know, possible impact of this future.But as you said he was scared that he was capable of that.He saw something in him that scared him.Well, what happened before before when?Except you don't feel like he's doing everything you can.because heDid she say that often?my phoneDo you feel okay?What is your agreement with them in terms of how much you work?because that feels familiarBecause it takes I mean certainly they should be more thoughtful of you.They definitely should but it takes two to be taken advantage of its both people who are either until into or just not thinking about another person and then you are not setting the boundaries.There's no separate.Well, we're going to have to stop for today.Can I just ask you if I I don't if I'll need this and if you can't do it, that's fine, but I'm wondering if we would be able to start 10 minutes earlier on Thursday.Is that a possibility?Okay.It would be 10.I'm not entirely I'm not entirely I'm teaching until the end of the month and my schedule is shifting a little bit.So I'm not even sure that would work, but would it be okay?Okay, okay.I very much respect times and don't like to move them.Okay, so let you know let's do 1:20 unless I contact you.Okay, very good.Have a good trip.Okay.Take care.Yes.Yes.Thank you.Press the button and make some noise.Take care.What's up, it's nice out.Yeah.It's less and less ego-syntonic.It's less that.Ego-syntonic is a word we use for certos.It's totally consistent with your sense of yourself and encompasses your whole sense of yourself.That's not what I mean.There's a very big difference.So ego-syntonic means something that just feels like youit's just consistency with your sense of yourself.As opposed to Ego distant distant onyc feels that it's something alien to yourself.It's a different balance than egocentric.It doesn't have anything to do with being self-centered self-centered or ego-syntonic s y nand ego dissego-dystonicso it's like being its walls in line and fits right in with yourself with your sense of yourself.Verses if you started hallucinating you might feel like wait, what's happening to me?This isn't me?This isn't actually happen to me.It sounds like it's starting to separate a little bit these kinds of experiences from feeling like they're just totally you.This is how you think this is what?It becomes something a flash of something you can recognize but there's some separated Miss from it.Feeling more and more ego-dystonic.It's not it's no longer taking away your sense of self.Yes, and it's moving in that direction where it's a thought that appears or a sense o I could have had those feelings butNot really who you are that's connected to your mother's voice or your the sense of all these old feelings.Sorry for the big word it started.yeah that used to take up so much energy in space andwhich one?I read parts of it not the whole book.because also are took you're talking about reading some pretty heavy-handed authors who a lot of people who a lot of people don't I mean people spend entire careers tryingcrosstalkYeah, crosstalk best different.Yeah, now it's sort of moving towards where there's more freedom to say.Okay, I didn't get those sentences and not be so critical of yourself.Wow.Other people because I hear your notes all the time about the things you're reading you have notes.I know whether you're writing them in the margin margin or not, but you have things you're thinking.Yeah other people somehow.Or if you want to read more because you want to read more you'll read more.But not feeling like you have to in order to feel good about yourself.Feeling the feelings of not being manic or depressed in a way having an ordinary emotional life, which is which has feelings are going to be feeling good bad.Ugly.I mean, they're all there in ordinary people but they're not it's not just waiting for this.Terrible Darkness all the time being on top of the world.It's not it just hasn't been like one of those.I think that's you're saying it's really disorienting.I also think in another piece you're talking about as we were talking about all these authors and philosophers and to your additions that it's starting is what if these aren't the other who have all the right answers.Because I think that's been a comfort for you to sort of the people who know what they're talking about and who are really smart and write a lot and our sounds like they know what they're talking about.And it also has a way of feeling bad about yourself that there's this whole body of people like that and what if what if they have some things to contribute but what if you disagree with some what if what if you think they're wrong orRight of you that were entrenched in their own histories or their own time there that's kind of disorienting to because there's no one on the pedestal anymore.You could be reading something and start saying what a crock of shit or she doesn't know what she's talking about.Everybody gets cranky.When is your first day at the office?MondayI didn't know if it started September 1st or October 1st, orSo you could have used it Wednesday.Not yesterday.crosstalkDo you have set hours assume their blocks?Yeah.Okay.Yeah.askSo will interfere with our Wednesday time then 12 to 4.Yeah, because it's a 4-Hour block.Yeah.So you have a 12 1 2 and 3.I think that's why I raised our appointment time because that's already going to interfere.Will you go there for an hour and then come back here and then go back?It is an hour of your time that you're paid for.So what will stop so what will stop you now come Monday.Do you think you'll be there?Okay, yeah.What's the feeling what's it like?And say I mean she feels so safe with you to be able to nozzle her way in and curl up wherever she wants to and take up whatever space she wants to and know that it's okay.Well, she's attached.I mean, she's feeling she's feeling loving affection.She's not wanting to attack is not even in the realm ofso affectionatewell around him you feel safe to if he's up vulnerable or has that many defenses up or there's so much stuff protecting going on because he's been so hurt somewhere oryou know, you're safe with an animal.It's connected the feeling you're having wandering around.What is this in between?You're not terrified of it.You're not elated about anything about it happening.Yeah.What can you send me more about what what it was feeling like just before you came in here because you were wandering around.You're thinking about this feeling that it's it's neither extreme.I wonder I guess how that then so then you come in here.Does that also throw you off here?What do we talk about them?Because I can imagine that if you're feeling depressed, you know what to talk about.Or like almost what else is in there, then what's going to be there?If it's not some extreme this or that were clinically significant something.Who are you?In a way or tuck these things you're saying is there's something then you get to start to know about what comes up inside of you isn't some extreme problem going on that's very easy to identify and talk about is not trusting yourself not trusting that what will come up.We'll come up even if it's a surface thing.That is the first thing that occurs to you that it comes up for a reason it connects to other things and nothing comes out of nowhere and everything has a meeting there's notYou're not trusting of just trusting of your mind.So you get to relax and justrightYeah.Now we really get to know you.Which is really different than knowing your problems.I think it's partly what you're saying.You're still getting used to the problems.What's going to be there?I'm leaving including that in problem as something that's not as grounded in reality trying to sort out who you really are.Yeah.Yeah, it's so different than trying to survive this the storm.It's so different.I think it's a metaphor for all the fears about the couch to what comes out.There was underneath underneath if you go into the deeper layers, what will I like?What will I not likeAre you afraid you'll find?It's funny because I was just having a fantasy of helping you into the water, but giving you a life preserver, so I could see you just float around for a while.Just know you're not going to drown.You can look around floaties.Yeah.You'd be safe wait until you start.Yeah, you could start that way what you can see from the top.I'm a scuba diver, so I know what it's like.I amYeah, it's quite the metaphor for going out into the ocean.Yeah.Going that deep.Yeah.Yeah, what?Yeah on the side.On the side not all the time.Yeah.Well, it is such a metaphor.I mean people have care of that.What is meant to be?so floatiesI can leave you some floaties on the couch.It's actually not that different unless you wanted to be when you go there and your mind to just as getting in the water.But the floaties it's not that different than standing on the side of the shore.Yeah.but I mostly I think it feels likeOh.ofsexy and I know it doesn't sound superficial.Yeah.In some ways you're afraid of is there something you're afraid?What is there something you're afraid?What happened?Well, you can stand on the side of a boat for the rest of your life looking in and never taking off because it feels for perfectly fine on the side of the boat.And then you never get to see.It's actually beautiful.but all the fears of what if it isn't andtotallyas though it's on permanent permanent thing.Or you start with snorkeling?That's what you do for a few years and then you get more interested in what's even beneath where you can see on top.wellSee you Wednesday.Okay, you too.Oh cold today.Good.No, it does sound like the way just really describe the last you're really getting into a place where you're making sort of very deep.Very dark feelings about yourself.Sometimes being able to know that you're unclear feelings or sometimes it can take over.I can imagine you really will have to find your way.You're out of it.What is that again?I've heard the word, but I kind of.It's odd.Domane attractive just about the physical.to youyou mean people?I guess I'm like, are you seeing it as there there's a hierarchy of appearance andonly a certain number of people would be found attractive.But it starts.Yeah.That's more what I'm saying is all that she told you one thing one that she did it to that.She told you it just feels like self-sabotaging self-sabotage or something.Of course, how are you going to respond to that?And so why depressing?I think it's part of your experience can be really hard to talk about in a personal way.When I started to say a few minutes ago.I said there are all these dark feelings about yourself that still need to come up and you really need to feel it.Do you really think you got anxious and said that I think other people feel this too and we've talked about that sort of sort of the movement of other people felt this way not just me because I think you do.I think you do start to get anxious like what if it's almost like what if it's true about me.If I am really the only one feeling this so therefore, it's me.And so it's really hard than to ever talk about your personal experience.You so often going to like the generalizations about Society?Where online dating is like this for all the people?It's not that like of course that's true on some level.But we never get to know.Rate your experience.Every person has a different experience of online dating, even though there may be General.So societal Trends towards something.It's a unique experience for every person in yours.I think once we even start to touch up on it on it you feel like oh what if I'm the only oneCan you play?Like if you start to talk to her about this problem.Does it make you feel like?Yeah, yeah.like if you areYeah.I wonder if you have any like do where that comes from, but you know like the idea that you're complaining and that's not manly.but specifically where that's not manlywow.I think it's hard for you to imagine what I actually want to hear a lot more than what you actually tell me.wellor because it's my job that then I can't really care to.Which means?Yeah, like it's just foreign to me to hear that.That's what's going on.And that you think that was my experience.You know, that's it's reallyyeah.Yeah, and I think what I'm saying you have about this is that it's very particular image from your childhood from your mother.And your father like his though.That's the that's the factual answer.Everybody thinks about what is it?What it is to be a man?raven, like there's no room forGo ahead.Yes.Yeah.Yes.That's exactly what I was going to say is that I don't think your experience with your mother and your father by the way because you've got either stoic because you've got either stoic and tough or constantly complaining.Without it going anywhere ever.as you two examples of what like these are the choices about how to beHow it divides up?So there's not room for actual like that ideas of having feelings or concerns or problems.a dark dark stuffThat you're sharing that that you're sharing that is not complaining.Like there's a falls into complaining sure if somebody like chronically complaining without anything moving and it was feeling when you fell I think it was your mother like you got shut out.That's one thing to me.It feels more like when I get to hear like a wisp of what actually what actually is personal to you.It feels more like just getting to know you.It doesn't feel like complaining.It feels like oh that's his experience rather than societies experience.I know what societies experiences I don't need to hear any more of that.Where do you just go?You know like another to it if you can follow this one of the reasons, I think you shut down when someone's talking is that for one it could be so it could simply be treating all the stuff in your mother.But in particular if what happens with your mother is her complaining her venting her smothering but the cost of seeing you at all like you disappeared then when you're with somebody who is venting complaining whatever bitching about a day.I think that will Child part but just once to actually be seen and validated an existing that relationship can really really can feel really smothered by this other person taking up a lot of space, but had you an experience where yousome of them probably do but some of them they are probably some that don't toyeah.You felt at home there.The capacity to really hear another's and just be there with them develops over that having been done for oneself, you know to not feel so squash by another person.Or if you trust him, you know the amount of listening right now, they'll listen to me tomorrow.They're here for me, too.How so?What?Let's say about that.What you're feeling right now is anxious.Is that what what's the feeling?You're down on yourself.I think at heart that's what you're saying.Is that your lonely sometimes?Smashing your face with a hammer.again, the prooflike it can't be true, right?What I tell myself.And they have been treated the same way.They haven't treated the same way.I think it's really cool.Maybe just like being with you and you were talking about.you say that Brian butI feel like it's been hard for you to be specific about what you experienced.When you hate what even dark what even dark feelings even mean, I mean, you know, lots of people have dark feelings, but it would help if you show me what it means and what you associate to it bringing things up memories.It's been my experience that when you have hit upon some of the real hard feelings and experiences.You see the four second you stay with them for a minute.And then you package them up nicely neatly into some play table form and put them back on the shelf and they remain there.They actually they never actually get to participate stay there and like really look at them, you know like that andanalogy of being in the storm and then the stormy waters then you called calm down and then you actually getTo beneath the surface and what's going to be down there and what happens if you're just swimming around in whatever it is you find I think that's a part of what it feels like you keep finding it and there still more is that of course this because it got packaged up so quickly and put away because it was so scary.I say, it's cool.And you say well gray.I don't want want to be somebody swimming around in the Darkness.But to be able to do that is new.That's a new capacity.It's a lot of feeling.sellablea bit of the raceIt's funny.You did compose the symphony sections because it came out in yourand that wasnot realYeah.No.You wanted to what you wanted to what?You wanted to what when you say I wanted to.that whatWell, I mean just one the question of what that means like what does over 80 y?Why does it feel why does it feel great sometimes or not great other times?sure shirtYeah.Okay.Here's the tally.Okay.Great.Good.I wonder why.Don't make a lot of sense if there's something emotionally you start feeling stuck and broken inside.Is it something about the video the story?I would guess it's not just a generic good cry, but something about the story let you let you get in touch with something.It sounds like you were feeling all week.Wonder what about the story?What were you going to say?Put you to shame.That's a lot of feeling.You remember you were here Wednesday of last week.You didn't allude to feeling exhausted at all that day.You didn't seem it.A lot of stuff came up on Wednesday.I mean all different aspects of getting intoSo you remember having that you have been feeling that way?depressedWhen was it was it that your mother you showed her the photo of Kelly to your mom.Do you remember when that was?You told me Wednesday.Because I have to wonder if that what you told me about.Wednesday was not with you as a piece of what?It was so much Ryan.I mean I was floored by in here and now things you were real and she had said to you that weekend and I don't know how that would have been like a punch in the stomach and you were handling it, but how could you not but how could I how could there not be you have different sets of eyes now and ears to hear and think about how what she saying to you that makes it now it's just a heavyweight when this actually happens now.What do you do with those feelings?couchouchWell, it's a very good question.What you do with all these feelings you're starting to have as things happen and you see them for what they are now.Can you say more about what the feelings are though?What do you feel?When she compliments our thanks you is is appreciated appreciative of your uncle and not now.angry atAnd what were you talking about last week with a photo and all the exchange around the photo?It wasn't just about the past.Do you know what I mean?She's actually saying things in the present that are very very critical.Yeah.If it's a rare comment that comes from something.Yeah, what about this is hard to stay with how I felt.Wanting to defend her and protect her.When you're with me you are.focus on the Absurd serenityWhen you're by yourself you complain.How do I feel what you felt watching this movie when you're here?I wonder why.What if it would help?What if it will help?another place where the couch can helpAgain, it's just a tool.But that's also one of the things sometimes it can do.You can find feelings in here without someone staring at you.Wow, so not just a locally-based thing you're saying.Wow.Are you considering not saying yes.I think that's a piece of what's changed so much Brian the last number of years and rapidly in the last since we started this is your capacity to do that.To channel it now in two ways that are healthy for you instead of self-destructive most of the time.It's an enormous capacity to just grow.Yes.And actually to find it when you're able to be honest with each other about sometimes when difficult things getting your first fight work it out.That's a relationship even the physical side of things actually gross.rightFirst issue that you have to explore explore each other.No yelling screaming.I wonder if Wednesday was too much.Maybe you're just like and we laughed about saying mental health break or taking mental health days.Maybe you needed a break from here on Thursday.You know, I think I may have said this before could have been years ago.There's a psychoanalyst psychiatrist whose well known around town died a number of years ago, but remained a legend in the area who describe the process of therapy basically as acknowledging bearing and putting it into spec into perspective as a three-stage process.I bring it up right now because I think that what used to happen for you if you would acknowledge and it would just fly you into a panic and it would be totally deregulating what would start to get to know about and you've been increasingly finding a way on the outside, even ifEven if just finding perspective around it, and I think that's what you're describing feel.So important to you that you can say it is what it is what it is in some ways that's telling oneself to put it in perspective.The only thing I'm bringing up is that in here, I think sometimes you also want to jump over the acknowledgement jump overbearing and into putting it in perspective that the bargaining part is hard.rightIf we only land in perspective without ever having gone through how bad it feels what you have come to know.It's a shaky container.Well, if you're never really mourned and grieved and gotten angry or so that you know, it snowed in your bones and effectively it's a different kind of knowing it's more like a muscling through the perspective which is so adapted that I think works for you A lot of the times out there.Where you at?And you're saying it actually could be helpful this time it unstuck something.Like for you to find the feeling.Yeah.Yes.Yeah, so you're doing work in Berry now?by yourselfTheir time than here where it looks like it's going to but then you stop it's like you're clamping down.And you'll say it but whatever dismiss away from it.Does it mean something I wonder what it means just to have the feelings in there?You're looking for like permission to?Absolve your guilt or something.and you've communicated thatwhy would you feel guilty?Although if she heard you heard you when you met someone new who you met on you get caught in the context.So your motivation then meeting her sounds like it would be more like in networking.even hereYou can feel fragile uncertain you could feel alone.Even when you're here.That's why I asked you about actually crying in the fact that it only happens in the most vulnerable way.Nautilus, not with companyThat's a start.I wanted to mention to you a time change possibly if you wanted if you wanted although it would have required a change and I don't know how do you feel about that?So few things if so if you need to think about it.I have one on Wednesday opening up.We do Wednesday Thursday Friday, so it would be three and three in a row.Would that work?Okay, okay.So starting next week.Do you want to do that?Okay.Okay.for WednesdayOkay, absolutely.Okay, so the week after starting Wednesday the 20th.Great.Okay, that works.11250 and 11:30Yes, and soon the 11:30 is going to change that 3:10 lots of changes.I know that this is getting confusing with the schedule.Okay, so we'll stick to Thursday Friday this week and then start the new one next week.Yeah.How have you been?What kind of things today are coming up as an example?Meaning they've been emptied but somehow God.I don't know.I just feel.They're both examples of people you're sensing that you're territories being encroached upon.You want to know if it's been harder to talk about in a way because it's like maybe this part that doesn't feel calm cool and collected.It feels confusing.What is this inside you when you recognize it's about in the moment and it feels like a small thing, but I don't know but I don't know that in the meaning of it is a small thing inside.It feels a little out of control.That's what we have to figure out when you're sitting up when you're sitting up there.I wonder if it's if that certain bond that set of feelings too.Then you're sitting there saying, you know, it's another place that feels like someone is encroaching on your space.And you say I can't help I just take it personally.Well, how would you think that when you said say that?Yeah, like what does it mean?What's the unconscious fantasy about it?I don't really.And what would happen if that would make you feel better?Yeah, because I wonder as we think about generalizing it to the garbage cans knew where it's not a until your family arrived.They're still even something happening about that.That is not about feeling claustrophobic with people.Other people's stuff other people's garbage.Does it make you feel like just a number when there's so many people like how much do you matter or something?I don't know why you wanted to just start talking about it.It's a nice dream you like the dreams you used to have you never say much about the dream beyond that it would be yelling screaming usually at your mother and now it's just an image of screaming in one form or another that there's anger there in all of this and how you felt heart felt hard to be in some ways intrusive and claustrophobic Lee humbling and present around you both neglectful and then intrusive at the same time.What's coming to mind when you say that?Because it looks like there's a lot of feeling going into that.How would they annoy you?How about angry?or claustrophobicsurrounded by people but stillYou're so quick to criticize it.But why did No Ceilings not mother?What about that sound right now?When was Adele and in your face through the day?Which is different than what I think you also know you're touring with understanding that you're because you're feeling this way today, you're picking up on things in different ways.You don't always feel this way.I mean even here.Sin becomes what?I get that part but what exactly is it?Is it like an intrusion?I don't know why I keep getting crazy images of something that sounds like a fantasy metaphor because we don't know concretely but something so so clear like as you described let's say walking into Starbucks and this is going to be the day where it's just a zoo and nothing goes my way like the feeling of just wanting to be held and in the environment too kind to kind of hold you and take care of you and have it just be okay and safe and quiet if you want quiet or loud if you want loud or social if you want social or or you know, just the wish for that kind of fallen and hold you that that it keeps getting some days.There's some feelings that that that make that feel like it's getting absolutely squashed.See, I think must have felt that as a baby learned pretty quickly that it wasn't worth it.I don't know exactly what I do know is but I do know his parents don't have a personality transformation between when their child is a baby and when their child is a child and so what we know about how how your mother responded to you as a child is also to be a piece of how she responded to you as a baby.So if they're narcissistically preoccupied preoccupied when you're 4 + 5 + 12 + 17 there probably are when you're a baby to even through a snapshot photo shows a moment where they are truly truly are getting narcissistic gratification over this baby.What is it about the baby and getting to know this little person and who is this person going to be or is it about the parents?Is it about her projection into the into the baby about who she wants the baby to be even what the baby means for her?so much for the feeling that this better that this one better besecond field in more desperate than and an investment like that would have happened with the first baby to now it's you you're carrying a load for two right away.How long before you was she pregnant for you was did she miscarry?It was after you.Okay.Do you know how long after?Do you know if she was trying to have a baby?You told about it because she told you about it years later.But if you had to know about it then to in some way kids pick up these things even toddlers even if you didn't know the didn't know with words.Did you say you didn't get in the show like a specific one?You've been trying to get into?What what are you saying?sadI wonder if I aggravated is easier to feel than sad feels like there's so much sadness aggravated.Well, especially if your anger is about feeling shut out or feeling like an outsider or feeling being encroached upon or just not being able to be left alone peacefully and intended to peacefully I think there's also as you're having those experiences right now, I'm emotional experiences about things happening out there that you're stating to be aware of really aren't quite about those things.There's a lot of sadness that was up next to that aggravation because because it's you're aware of having been having been happened already that you were feeling this as a kid.When you were encroached upon as a kid or treated as an outsider.Felt like you're alone in your own family.At least you just want some peace and quiet space.You can be a part of the family.You know, this is evidently sitting there alone.And even you don't get sometimes to know someone will take care of you.Even me sometimes you show up here and it feels like I'm not taking care of you.I made appointments to close together starting you a couple minutes late, even when I'm even when I'm feeling you.If it sounds like it's boiling down to the feeling that while really at the end of the day, I'm alone.That's not really anybody that's going to there's not really anybody that's going to be there.Were you feeling that way here Monday?Do you remember anything about being here there I stated.started some wayWhat was the dream what's so important?a man or a womanDo you remember more about the feeling and how you're thinking about dreams or part of the dreams?Yeah, were you sad?My guess would be a lot you don't entirely know all of it, but it's pretty Avoca.Do I mean for 1 just to progression from friends with NBA players getting checks in the mail to driving and sleepy driving and watching Netflix.It's sort of like it sort of feels like it's coming from big dream to kind of ordinary experience when you run into a friend and she's going to medical school and you're saying that that's good for you, but you're notBut it's not NBA and big checks either.It just sounds more real.Do you mean that in your dreams or do you mean literally waking?I wouldn't say so.I mean, it's such a metaphor right?I don't know.Where is I'm thinking the struggle of being in the driver seat and driving forward initiative you figured that in that space you feel like you're in charge of but then it feels then it feels like it fears off and it gets confusing or get sticky again.You're not an agent with initiative and clarity.till tomorrow310What's new?Oh, I don't think so.Probably Celexa, I think Celexa and Lexapro, you know how there is right-handed and left-handed molecules.I think one's one and the others the other.That's too bad.I'm going to put this on if you can talk a little louder, right she offered to drive you back.So what day was that?right, so you have the double whammy ofThat kind of thing has been happening.Did dr.Bond estimate things would improve?Why did you switch?Yeah.rightThey like being appreciated.a chemistry professorI see sort you out.big or small wordsthat only makes it so much more stressed rating and it isI think you get lots of your mom's Wellbutrin questions, essentially, you know.Yeah, well, there's an obvious and simple explanation for this.Are you clearly haven't thought of and tried?Right.I mean the only pieces that I start to wonder about and this is probably the same as everybody else.There's a partial mild aspect of did you set your dad up a little bit in the following way.In fact, you've been frustrated over thinking about struggling with this for years with Chet and have tried many different things are completely exasperated and you and you know thinking he's a terrible manager for 12 different reasons as well as and you haven't talked too much explicit explicitly about this.I mean you've alluded to it today and other times his sexism and racism which also contribute to things that make him hard to deal with that all seems like to me in a quite relevant context the question of hey, I asked my manager for work.Give me an e. What do you think I should do.Do you know what I mean?I don't know maybe that stuff your dad already knows but I guess with your dad kind of unlike your mom.I'm not surprised to hear you say your mom has a question about Wellbutrin like but the story you were telling your dad if he knew all that stuff.Maybe He suggests the Ben Franklin thing, but he wouldn't say it's just a communication problem.Maybe he would I don't know.It seems to me like there's a lot of sort of amount of time amount of effort erroneous sense of beating your head against the wall, the berries criticisms of chat that you have and which are well-earned by Chet that he doesn't know and that I imagined make his response both seem sillier and more madden mean to you.Don't imagine you're expecting him to have a solution for you.I imagine you wanted him to be sympathetic that like they drive you nuts and especially for somebody who a is your dad and B, you knows the workplace.He's an HR person like yeah, if you said a horrible manager can a horrible manager really can make a job miserable.That makes sense given what you said before?I imagine it feels to you like kind of a fantasy.He has that if you handle it, right if you communicate right or if you sort ofStrategic or understand the situation well enough that you won't run into problems like that.I imagine it feels sort of like kind of denial that he does about other things, too.See.Like you may be terribly vulnerable in the workplace and sometimes handling it in a certain way will help other times.It won't make a damn bit of difference.I see I wasn't aware.I wasn't aware.That's how it worked.The way that you're entirely vulnerable position with chat and you feel like people kind of want to look the other way from that.Yeah.Where do you have his support?I mean you're saying the skills he gave you don't work and probably backfire.That seems like it was a quite a hurtful conversation.Originally, you're feeling really vulnerable upset and frustrated about something and he's not being supportive about that and also telling you it's your fault.Tell me about is like you're his daughter and he's saying you failed to be diplomatic.You know what I mean?I know he's not sitting next to you at work.But you talk to a lot of people and say a lot of things and his saying that he thinks you're not good at communicating without giving examples of things.He seen firsthand or that he imagines you're not diplomatic without explaining why he thinks that's based on his own sense of you.I don't know I guess makes I imagined could feel like he's disconnected.You guys have sat at the dinner table probably plenty of times.Do you come across as somebody who has trouble communicating?You guys have the communication thing.You guys have the communication thing.at Publixhahatime's almost upYou take care.How are you?How are things it's been awhile.You said you got a new monster guy?That's what I think part of it is just even to get start noticing how awesome that.Compson comes up in your mind how much it's there as a whip, even if all you're doing in the beginning is just noticing it more how ingrained you're saying that is that it comes in.Is that exact statement specifically?Wow.You said you tried a couple of other things first that didn't stick at all.So what but that they didn't work like it didn't feel.Like what?I'm curious what came out first.It sounds like sort of one Distortion coming into replace another Distortion more than a challenge.Yes, yes.interestingeven by just seeing somebody I'm a team in other words.You didn't do anything wrong.You didn't say anything wrong.It is a really interesting thought you're that you come up with because right on the face of it.It sounds almost invalidating.It's going to be okay Ramona stop overreacting or something.But I think the reason you're saying it might be doing something that feels better is it does like when the thought I hate myself comes up in a way triggered by tremendous anxiety.In other words.What's it's not what's not on it's very obvious.I hate myself can be a start of Selfridge self-critical spot, but I think that what's less obvious but actually is functioning.A lot of the time is that it's a thought that you have to manage your anxiety.You know what I mean?So you start feeling you can start feeling out of control.You can start feeling like you'll neverGet to where you want to be.You can start feeling like I'm not going to get a job.I'm not going to get an A and that I hate myself that kind of whipping yourself back into shape becomes a way of kind of getting control of a situation that feels out of control.rightYeah, this is the only outlet for all those feelings some of which is actually meant for people out there.originallyAnd it doesn't go anywhere.Right, right.That's what you had to do.That is what you're having to do a lot of the time at least.with IvanYeah, I totally get that.Do you know the story of The Emperor's New Clothes?Do you remember that?It's an old fairy tale.It reminds me of that.So there's a boy that the essence is that of the story is there is a boy who sees that The Emperor's New Clothes is that he's naked and he's going around to stay and everyone look at my beautiful expensive clothes and everyone is an acting as though he has beautiful expensive clothes how beautiful your lovely no one is saying a word and the little boys only one who says we don't see these naked he has no clothes on there's no one around who's confirming that because they're all they're all thinking in the story probably just came kowtowing and placating to this emperor that reminds me that you're the only one if your left yourself in the system is like especially I think you're not here and we're not talking about some of the reality and have a benevolent boys coming in to say actually this isn't okay.What's happening in Ivan?You're the only one who sees it.I think that's how it feels right now.You can't even I can't be spoken about it almost becomes unreal, then if your parents can acknowledge, it Ivan's parents can acknowledge it Ivan can acknowledge it.It sounds like dr. Ferro can't is it always acknowledging it as real see you start to doubt your own experience.Maybe it's just me.Maybe the problems.I mean, I don't think that's true, Ramona.I hear you as a child.There was no point to come in to that conclusion.That is for sure as a child because you know, you probably tested it over and over again or Moana.We know you did away.Maybe this time you can clean the all of your pleadings your tabs.You're saying maybe if I say it in this way or do it this way or do it for them?Maybe they'll catch on you've tried so many different ways of getting through to them and none of them worked.So you learned over time.It didn't make any difference to label their problems as their problems.It did not make any difference for your experience, right?It didn't make things better for you.They didn't change as a result of your saying it.You're otherwise so alone with it.You're not going to a group of friends and saying get a load of what my parents are doing.Yeah, the question is that we've been trying to think through and get to understand is whether Ivan is exactly like your parents are not if he's exactly like them and that they no matter what you say.When did they wouldn't change if that's who he is you were stuck with the same thing and that is sort of like we have to sit is beating your head against the walls try to kind of get him to change cuz that's never going to happen.And then we got sort of changes our conversation.What do you do with that that what do you want to do with that?What does that mean to you?If this is always going to be this way.It's never going to get any better to degree that to the degree that he's maybe like them some but has more potential for change that would invite us to thing.Okay.So what how do we help you in the time that he's changing?How do we find?Is there a third option besides getting angry at him in a way that it feels like you're beating your head against the wall because doesn't do any good.Returning that anger back at yourself because I think that also destroys you is there any other room for anything else in between those places is the question if there is room for him to change.It's helping him.You don't came up with the idea.It's not silly at all.who said that they stuff I have an idea, but I'm curious what your feeling like is the biggest elephant in the room and you want to talk aboutYeah, what?That's an understandable thing to wish for.No.It's really really hard to live and put up with it and tolerate someone who's depressed for a long time that you care about.strainingYes, you do, you know some things about what you would have done differently if you were her.It's harder for me imagine that if you went through about a very severe depression with a child that you might not say something differently.Then she said to you.So you couldn't get out of bed.It's such a repetition for you.I mean, so sometimes people say see things in other people that aren't only a little bit there and the thing things that are a little bit they see really big because of their own histories why the timer Moana people end up for example, marrying someone who is just like their parents or parent a caregiver who actually like that because that is what familiar and safe unconsciously.You don't know you're not like people goDo that on purpose but this is why someone who's beating a child.I've said this you marry someone who beats her as an adult.That's not what's not that she's pretending that's happening or she's protecting projecting onto her husband that he's beating her up.He's actually beating her just the way she was beating that was a child.That's really happening.So it's my experience again.I don't hear Ivan's side of the story, but I do hear even still I've met him once I hear through both dr. Farrow and dr. Board.This is really happening in him.I think the only places you get stuck around it are actually are around signing with that third option might be besides desperately and being enraged and critical of him and desperately being enraged and critical of yourself.That's what the legacy of your childhood with your mom in this instance and Dad.Because your dad also wasn't speaking up saying Ramona.Your mother is really severely depressed.This has nothing to do with you.The reason she stays in bed.All day long has nothing to do with you.I don't want you to take responsibility for it.I'm going to hire a housekeeper so we can get some help around the house.Right?He wasn't also standing next to you saying the emperor is naked.I see it too.So this Legacy it leaves you only with the option you had either to just try to get through that to them desperately or to put it back.All in on yourself is the way of getting control.You don't have internalized inside you how to negotiate the differences and disagreements and problems.Feeling like you didn't have to turn it all in on yourself.And you also could have some different kind of patience and love go around it to like it would have been so much better for you.Had your mother said to you.I'm so depressed.This is something called depression.This is what it's called.This is what I'm doing trying to get myself into treatment and get better.This is nothing to do with you.I don't want you to feel responsible for me.I love you so much.I wish I could get out of bed, but I can't that would have been really different even though she still would have been depressed.You see what I mean?Just in Communications.I'm holding in mind your mind and still trying to take care of your mind needs even while doing that and I think that had that even that happened even if she still has severe depression you would have been able to say okay.This is my mom and her problem and I'm not happy.It doesn't mean you and the depression isn't a problem.It's still problem if she's lying in bed all day long.That's not good for any person right so you could have your reaction.Also not have it feel like your whole sense of yourself revolves around what's happening with her you could feel free to kind of feel good about yourself regardless of what's happening with her and I think that that's was still stuck in with Ivan, but it's hard to kind of feel like you see what's happening with him and have some reactions to it feelings about it and frustrations and disappointments and have what's happening with him not totally impact your sense of you.Does that make sense?Yes, it is.That's really happening, Ramona.What's a real 5 months?You're so right and it's also so good and healthy that you could for that split-second make that connection that maybe he's not actually angry at you.In fact, it's safe to get angry for him.One of the things that means is that you're like the safe Outlet.I know that's not exactly the fun to be and a safe place for somebody to angry.But that means your relationship with him isn't a different maturity level and the relationship he has with his parents where it's not safe from those feelings are just found the outlet in you but they're actually meant for them.They're the feeling and she couldn't Express in them.And that's the new right?That's pretty now.I also wondered if as you were telling me the story The only piece of the anger that might actually have been for you and maybe this is just the way I heard it.But the way you said it to me it was that you said to him this Ivan.This is not okay what they're doing.I think that so I just wonder about like if you said Ivan that I feel I'm sad for you that feels like neglect abuse Ivan 5 month.Do you know what I mean?In other words picking up on your own empathy for him instead of I might hear if I'm him.I might hear you saying this is not okay as a kind of rude of him and an attack of his parents instead of the we are actually feeling also is like wow for a second how poor Ivan to it is certainly not okay for you either because this is affecting you but I had to put up with this his whole life.Also this kind of neglect.I just I guess I'm wondering if you might have more space to feel actually to start to feel his own anger.If you were to say that.I'm sorry.Do you know what I mean?But it actually gets his experience gets validated and gets to its it gets to grow from within him.I think when he hears you getting angry and he gets scared.He just gets scared at anger.I think any sort of clams up and goes inside and that got angry back at you in a way the essence of what you're saying is that this is really not.Okay.It's very poor treatment of him is neglectful.No.This is Cason point.You have a specific time you supposed to go home.So that she'd be down there with you.What are the projects you're going to do at your parents house?meaningSo what would be like Ramona to?Say Actually I don't even care if you make the list and then you rip it up and say I'm not doing the things on the list.This is not my home.It is not I'm not living here.You have to spend I don't know what 3 4 5 days there.a weekOkay, long weekend, and then you're back to your home, but the energy into your house.When she says they need help with things does this mean they're actually asking the two of you.When you guys come home, can you do this this and this?With what?100howWill she get a lot of money for these then their new?I don't know.Are there a lot of money?And then what will she do with the money?She like shopping.What else does she shop or is it closed?That she reads to.He's a reader.And she's not going to the library or something.seriouslyThat is not rude.You can go to a bookstore anytime.You're here to visit your daughters.Oh my goodness.Oh my goodness.So what would happen about it?If you decided that you're not going to help with the projects around the house.What do you is something going to happen while you're home?Will they get really mad?I don't actually sound like they would it's not like you're demanding you do this.It's hard to break out of that cycle.Some help.Sure.The only thing though is here's what I'm feeling about where you are now as a child affect your daily life.If you didn't if you couldn't find a pathway or if there are dust bunnies everywhere Arthur's color everywhere.It was affecting your sanity your living space your comfort you had to do these things in order to keep up with your own life.You now don't have to do that at that house.Really so she would do that.Are they came home to a fairly clean house?massive undertakingcleaning the dishes that kind of thing.hardhomeThey might like that you're there, but they're not actually showing that they're really enjoying and making room for spending time with you.That's crazy.That's so messed up.my goodnessOh my goodness.really addicted to workWow.parentsShe was gone for a year.Are they in a fight?There's not some tension going on.You're so alone.It's like graduation all over again.Yeah, I got to the top of it.Well, we're going to have to stop let's prioritize talking about what I'm going to ask you to think about this week might be a reasonable set up for goals and extra cheese for you to set up for yourself for a visit home with your parents and by that.I mean I'm suggesting to you.All right, what if you're strapped the list and you kind of look at me likeNot a chance that that's happening.So maybe that's not reasonable and realistic.Maybe that's asking too much of you know what I mean?That isjust this is so ingrained in you and even your sister to do this.That what would be something that would be challenging to yourself to try something new around it a little bit.What would be something like it carves out a little bit of space for you and let go of the piece of responsibility.It might look something like maybe you say okay, we will grieve for a couple hours on one of the days.We're going to sit down and help her take photos and put stuff up on eBay or whatever that would look like.That would be the project that we tackle that we won't tackle some other like cleaning up the garage or whatever would be the other kinds of things that are running on your list that you'll agree to one but not an endless.I'm at you and your sister might then try to say we would love to if it would if we could somehow do it XYZ together.I don't know what that would be kayaking going to movies going out to dinner communicating thatTo your parents and even maybe a green with each other, even if your parents don't show up in whatever capacity that you and Emma do that you enjoy your hometown together.You do something sure your vacation together.And again, this is just one iteration of what that could look like, but just trying to think about okay, how do we get a little bit more space for new adult Ramona to not feel quite as responsible because this actually doesn't impact your daily life anymore.It's going to impact weekend.But you have your independent life now, you don't it's not your household you're living in and you can start to try to press a little bit into letting go of some of that.Does that make sense to think about it?I just want to ask if there's room for you to do this one this week.If you notice a time or two or three or the statement, I hate myself comes out.Could you write a little bit about where you are and what's happening how that thought came up just kind of put context is so we can get a couple it's partly for us to talk about but also partly for you to really get like what are the feelings is a shame.Is it anxiety is it?I should be going on but doesn't have Outlet out.So it's turning back on myself.That's driving that thought when then what happens when you say it's going to be okay even using it at home.It's going to be okay.We're going to figure something out that's going to protect you a little bit not a lot.Maybe not a lot yet but a little bit so that there's something new starting to grow about the potential in you and just right just a few.Down a few details.If you want to email it to me.That's cool.If you want to bring it in bring it in cuz that make sense.Okay.Good to see you.Good morning.I'm doing okay.Let's see a quick thing about insurance.So Blue Cross seems to be pain up over the rate.They said they would.You saw that too.Okay, so I mean I don't need to take any more that I'm taking.I'm it's not exactly an air.I don't think for various reasons.At least.I don't feel compelled to let them know.So, I mean my thought was essentially just a credit you or write a check.Okay.hahaOkay.Yeah, so I'll write you a check for what they've done so far and I don't know if they'll I guess I won't be keep doing it if they approved more visit, but we'll wait and see and can I just have like my bank send a check to your house?Is that okay?I think you're actually had at this point.I'll double-check but I think that's right.Okay.Good.Of course.Wow.You're such a loving and devoted daughter.Enjoy slowly.That does make a certain kind of sense.Yeah, no, I understand.It.Just sounds like you worked very hard.I mean happily butthe hardAnd you're sort of goal or intention is to connect with everyone there.I don't think it's solely because there are only a few people who could be talking everyone that you're one of the only people who is that might be part of it though.I don't know.What is I think they're probably something important to how it matters to you to really connect with everybody there.There might be multiple reasons for it, but it seems important.Right.How is the trip end?How is your son doing at college?Like a very specific reference to a previous conversation.Yeah, it's like you really almost maybe even a little bit like scrumptiously try to bring yourself to each conversation.like with careful attentionYeah, you've been very very on.And enjoying it and into it.An immersed but also sort of and most importantly not aware of how much energy and effort it takes and how it can Tire you out after a while.Yeah, the thought that I had was that.I wonder if sort of given the contacts and given what you wrote how much it's an impart sound up with your relationship with your parents.Like it's kind of like part of how you reflect what they shown you about family.And part of your sort of devotion and appreciation for that.hahaYeah.I never knew that.Yeah.I just moved there.Done his defense.Yeah.What was it?haharightYeah.Is your dad working long hours?the HarvesterOh.What were your thoughts and reaction?Sure.BussyIt is also possible.I don't think this is a comment how she was I don't know but you know some others who are depressed pull it together pretty well.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.We have about 5 minutes.One thing I'm wondering about is the extent to which you feel a similar kind of pole or sense of being.On and how you would want to talk and connect you.And what you were you would be lost or I think more specifically that like I might miss about you or we might not share if you're not that way.Yep.Somehow that could happen differently if you weren't his Focus like, you know what I mean?When I'm getting it.I see I guess I had thought that there's maybe something that gets left out a little bit and making the effort.I'm not saying that it's bad to make effort.That's certainly not what I'm saying, but that there's some part of you that gets left behind a little bit.Or judge by you, not quite as good or worthwhile in some way.I think that's the part that isn't involved with trying or something.It may be irrelevant.But it's just funny how these things come up together.It does make me think of your mom being kind of depressed when you were little and feeling like even she could manage that pretty well and how she was with you that it took effort.You know what?I mean, like how to gather herself somewhat.Well, I'm not going to answer that one.I guess you may be asking rhetorically.Okay.We need to stop unfortunately.I'll have to think about.I'll have to think about.I think I do to tell you the truth.I think it's so that I will shut up and let you talk.Hi.I'm wondering if one reason it's difficult to talk about it is because it feels like something that I get maybe a little bit more or an easier to talk to you about it then James and that is not uncomfortable.I can think that it's embarrassing to ask what I think because it's hard to imagine that I'm not thinking critically of you or maybe you're not being in more control or not being more rational or for even being involved.I see.I think you're really anxious because you're describing.I think how other people play an important part in putting you in a double bind, but I think kind of offloading blame or mentioning how that pisses you off is pretty terrifying at the moment.I suspect because I'm going to retaliate in some way maybe and even a little concerned that saying what it feels like I'm doingYeah, I guess I was thinking more like you might feel like I was retaliating by pointing out that you were laying blame on other people and that that would make you feel anxious and guilty and as though I was kind of throwing it back at you in some fashion.If it doesn't feel that way to you.That's great, but I sort of understand.I have the impression that has something to do with my saying that's not how it feels.RCI see now.That soundsI feel like you were being like I was going to hear that as you being critical of me.somethingI wonder if somewhere it felt like telling me how I was self-centered which it seems to me you're feeling is one of the worst things in the world in a way that sort of third rail for you when you feel like you're being that way.I see.There's no if it's worse if you're actually making the decision of whether to do that and how as opposed to my asking you to do that.Is it sort of related to say that the most you let yourself think that this is about you and what's going on with you the more likely you'll be disappointed that it actually becomes about me and what I need.in some way that I'm going to disavow likebut in somewhere like our relationship is going to emerge as being like my needs and why is that I'm going to just bow.Does Samia pretty close to what I'm saying?Although I guess when you describe me fucking with me.That makes it sound more deliberate really.I think we should finish for today.Hey.What is this?Huh?That's pretty easy to believe.Well in one sense, I completely like I completely agree that in one sense.It doesn't mean.Your point I gather is it doesn't really mean a damn bit of difference in any field.Okay, I see I wasn't sure whether you meant surviving getting a job.We must be quite difficult to know how to think about where Orient to work when you've been having such a disastrous time of it.Play Majid leave you a kind of loss to have to constantly think about work or a lot.of anythingyou don't really know what to do or how to talk about it.Don't make abut you look now and of course you have it from other times recently almost like a kind of holding to yourself.I don't mean to make you feel so upset and subconscious, but I could imagine in a case something about how you're feeling.Maybe instead of what you want.Because this mostly is what you been doing.Yeah, and you feel like like catatonically.You didn't quite shut down.Feel It In Like A Very physical way whereYou feel it in any differently here than like at home.To me.There's something quite important about how difficult it is to sort of put any words do it.In fact, actually when you said those it was actually kind of difficult to be feeling it and kind of clearly in touch with it and talking about anything at all.I guess there are things that occur to me to ask when you describe you use the word sad that doesn't sound like it's clear that goes with the sense of a loss or a longing or being upset by something.or being beatbe more like wind down or be more like not like you don't have to anything to fight in you.I think I suppose it has seemed to me at times like your depression is slipping into a sort of this kick the shit out of you in every possible way and if he everything you try to do.How it happened?why no one idea that I had about it that I kind of got at the moment is like it makes me think in a way a certain kind of demonic Obsession and which the more you pay attention to the depression as such and kind of do something about it the angry and more vengeful the demon gets and the more you have people around trying to make contact with the part of you that is hurting so terribly and so sad and so troubled by what's going on and you're angry even yet and the next question for me is why why would you be so dead set against feeling better against what's really going on in again what it's really like and I'm not sure but probably has something to do with some kind of very profound like lost that you feel and that sort of having people to be closer actually makes you feel more soWhen is a sample of the first part that's coming to mind is from a couple of weeks ago 3 weeks ago.Maybe now it was that Tuesday when you I think he must be when you and I met and you had an easy tea and then you kind of decided after that that you really needed to be in the hospital when we have talked.You were hopeful that the ECT would help you feel better and that it didn't do you remember at all?Okay.Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I have my facts straight on it because I remember thinking about the time you had said to me that day as well when you're done with it before it seemed like the ECT was helping not such a pain to sleep, but it was making a difference you thought.Yeah, and then you're feeling really crummy that morning your were like I'm going to have an ECT and I had asked does it tend to help right away or does it take awhile?And I think you referred to their being kind of lift usually fairly soon after we didn't talk until a day or late or later a day or maybe two later maybe three because you were back in the hospital.But if I recall you made it clear that you didn't feel any better you couldn't have if you know, the decision was made talking to a doctor there that you really needed to be back in the hospital and that was the best thing and I remember thinking of the time gosh it almost kind ofIt almost like you kind of had to show yourself.It wasn't working over the depression.It could be stronger.I know it probably sounds a little bit crazy thing to say, but it was almost like, you know, you were starting to lean on a little bit and he started to appreciate getting some help on this and it's almost like you kind of had to make a point that showing you that it wasn't going to work.It wasn't going to work.It was that day, you know, I mean, it doesn't in a way mean that it doesn't help at all or can't help but I think it away and maybe kind of determined to show that it wasn't going to be stronger than the depression.I mean the why question I'm more speculative about like I wonder things like historically is there a way that started being depressed growing up was one of the truest things you can do, you know, like, you know, what other ways you sort of complying and trying to be or like find at least not to make noise or maybe sort of I don't know.Maybe you felt like pretty in the Machinery there.I'm feeling pretty powerless.And you know, I wonder if being depressed is one of the ways you can kind of be honest and also show that and also in a weight be very powerful that nobody is going to take that away.We're going to stop in a minute, but I was just checking with you about the whatever more or less about this.Turned out pretty hard.Yes.When did Candace leave?When did Candace leave?You went in today?Was it bad for you were things bad last night?Okay.Okay.Well, I'll call you.Hi.Good.I will be meeting with him like very occasionally every 4 or 5 weeks or so at this time.at the same timeit doesn't matter.All right.I'm going with it matters.I understand.Seeing him.as though it an indication of your like not being together somehow or not being able to handle yourself orlike not being able to get a piece of work done that you wanted to do or something like that.Do you feel a little more like you can sort of both acknowledge that and heated and not necessarily look like a fuck up in the process?You seem very frustrated.What do you mean?It is something you have to go through.The way what gets put into place.I'm aware that you're struggling with things.Like you can't put the words together.The impression that I get and maybe this is not what it's like is sort of like being in one of those states where you kind of are kind of half asleep or drifting off to sleep and something wakes you up and you have all the stuff that was like right there on your mind.You can't quite fit it or put into words or you wake up from it dreaming even though you were wishing.I was kind of gone and it feels like it's very present.Yeah.You seem to shake your head at first, but that does seem kind of what it is like.And you seem to be left with does the dream Seymour, right?You have you seem to have liked some of that evident and like feelings and reactions from the dream, even though you don't kind of remember it like you look upset and you look frustrated.I think you're trying to say something about how you feel the way with the prior, you know, thinking some thoughts about that.You also do seem like increasingly connected you seem closer to being able to say something sort of that you've been.Yes.I know it seems like you're not quite there.Yeah.Never quite able to do the thing that you really need to do.I think so the question that then goes through my mind as well.And so what's the big deal and I think that the biggest deal about it is you're feeling that you always have to be able to do for yourself.Thank something just now or working at Starbucks or showing the apartment or getting school work done.I think you hold on one of the things that really keeps you together.Is that feeling of being able to sort of do for yourself?Whatever it is that you need to do that you need to do.That's when that's gone.The bottom drops out.Here, I think the way of being played out is if you can't say something if you can't do for yourself that way I can't help you.I think that's probably part of it.I can't help you and it's your fault.Yes.There may be another part of you might feel also a very fond wish to be put it like I'm not sure about this, but I wonder if you feel like a kind of countervailing.Wish to not be able to do anything and be taken care of or helped in any way.I wonder I don't know about this, but I wonder if there's a part of you that and if it's true, I think this is a part of yourself.You probably hate.Vigorously, but sort of is probing or testing.Well, what if I can talk, you know kind of still get help.Yeah.Yeah at the place where I can kind of see that kind of like go for like popping his head up most visibly is in the release you can feel being in the hospital.You know where there's some you know, that part feels like okay here.I don't have to do anything.Like I can just you know be taken care of and who is really going to run with that.I would say let the booze going to suck and there's just no two ways about that.But you tend to be pretty critical of the hospital in some ways.I personally have to agree with a lot of things you're critical about.You know, some of the kinds of care they don't provide and get to know you and the stay so short, you know, like I think I get it, you know, and I agree, but I wonder if there's something else going on there as well, which is that you're sort of your directing out were some of the fiery do you have for Giselle for wanting to be there?You know kind of like well, I'm not really getting taken care of here and I want to be clear about that and I'm like having mental and like having been totally right about them because I couldn't take it if I was bragging on myself actually wanted to be here and feeling released.Again, I'm not saying that maybe when it's less true things get a little tricky with you.It's like if it was me, I agree with a lot of things you but that doesn't necessarily sort of me.So very effective.Maybe there's like a off and we'll say well I don't know what to do about it, which maybe is again like we didn't was sort of competence and activity in the sense of having to do for yourself.If I just said something.I think it's difficult for you.Your first thought is okay.Well I should do something really about this.And I guess what I'm saying is I think that's I think I said something with you that it probably are kind of disturbing and your go-to is like, okay.Well, I guess I should do something.You know, I'm not sure what to do OSHA likeis thatOtherwise, you're laughing a kind of more helpless more dependent.Much more scary.visionwe're going to stop in a couple minutes.I just want to check in about like cutting sincehave you wanted toprobably James has kept you from it.Yes, you've been thinking about suicide.So you're referring to more cutting yourself or?That makes sense.I'm justtrying to because you haven't been thinking about suicide lately.Yeah.anything elseLet's see.I got a call from dr. Vaughn.Yesterday like right after noon and I'll call her back today.I think she just wanted sort ofmore information about what's going on.Okay with me.Of course.You lost me there a little bit.I know what you meant.I'm not sure how it connects.You're using him as a standing.Right, but I guess you'd want to know how much your kind of putting your desire to not hurt yourself and to be alive and to him and how much it's just not there.What sounds like you're pretty mad at James are pretty resentful of him and we don't know if just like what you said before if that's cuz of what he wants or what you want what you're giving him to want whatever for the moment.Yeah, and I guess the idea is that if it weren't for him damn it, you could just be dead.And I would get you out of this.You would stop being a prisoner in your own life and you'd be done suffering.I guess that's what it feels like whatever the hell else is going on.Yeah, I guess another aspect of it is that he's really betraying you like your loyalty eating you alive and his disloyalty to what really matters the most to you, which might be being dead is also keeping you alive.I had the impression that there's something dangerous about the possibility that I do care about what happens to you.Meet at the moment, but one thing it makes me think that is I'm pretty sure with some of the including house kind of both of you in a way over looking what you feel like you want the most.I think that probably felt like me taking your side a little bit or at least seeing your side.Yeah, seeing your side.And I guess it seems to me relevant is that when I was seeing your side you had to remind both of us that I don't really care.What happens to you.Probably it'll be harder to talk to me if I care what would happen.Imagine you feel like this is pretty cool.For both of you that way.Yes, that's right.And you been somewhat functional which I think is also a lot of effort and work and not hurting or killing yourself, but still it's a lot of work.Yeah, and he's forcing that on you.Where you want him say that so you can just end it.Yeah, you really have it in for yourself, huh?I don't know you seem angry or to me than you seem sad at the moment not so I don't imagine you're feeling both.Let's back up a little bit.What are the angry thoughts?I feel like your choices are between leaving people.You care about quite upset and unhappy and how you're feeling or killing yourself and making them even more and that if you had any use at all and you'd be able to figure out a way out of this or would make it better, but you can't do that either.So this is like another job in a way that yourI think it seems like the times you felt the worst when there is something you feel you should be able to handle that.You just can't like attack.Like with the apartment and showing the apartment or stopping school or work like Starbucks?Or maybe there's a moment you start to listen to yourself and take how much you're hurting more seriously.Yeah, I think what I said just probably made you feel worse.You really can't do it.It's really just too much.Do you say you're done with Starbucks and go what you're saying?Cuz I feel like something you can do.Well, if because of what it means to you, you know, it's not about physically making coffee and running around for 8 hours difficult as those things can be as I understand.But that's not why you can't go back there.It's because of what it means.I think you have to be forcing yourself to do that.I thought I wonder how much you are.Also feeling really worried about whether you're going to be able to do this therapy.I mean this was triggered by stuff we talked about on Friday, which is just what the doctor made you so scared about.I do not doubt that it did.And this really is the main thing you're doing these days probably in an addition to like keeping yourself alive and keeping yourself married.I know like for a moment, it feels like a Lifeline but I imagine you're also really scared.You're going to lose it.But things are going to get stirred up that you were going to make that are going to make it impossible or too overwhelming for you to do or maybe that I don't think so.I'm not sure if I'll think so you'll think so or what butYeah, I think that I hope it's very clear that I'm not in any way making a case about what you should do, but I'm out of Starbucks maybe taking some of the heat from therapy here.Like Starbucks May well be impossible in some way again.I'm not striving to say otherwise, but I wonder if you're turning a little bit from what from really worrying about being able to do this to that.He definitely can't do that.You may not be able to do that entirely independent of this.I don't.I think another thing that makes a scary is an addition to the lifeline aspect of this I suspect you I'm pretty sure that you have done something one of them very interesting that you have done here Sebastian hope which is in pretty short supply and I make the prospect of not being able to do this I think all the scarierRiveryeah.Yeah, well, we should stop being in touch with and yeah, I'll get back in touch with dr. Vaughn.I got your message about theprobably yeah.Okay, I think I must have taken that one.All right.Well, I'll if they require likerightRight, I guess I wondered in the sense of transfers.I took the Epp.I got a million hours experience.I don't know whether I would have to do it in their state.That would be a problem if I could count whatever was done or what I had done in University.That's not a big deal.and by a huge feeAll right.Well, let me look really pretty easy to find out where the information was.Well again, it's possible that some of that stuff might be more feasible.Sure.Good.What do you mean?I could find you guys a is he still seeing Smith?Okay, she's just more in that Community than I am.So she would probably be she could probably think of names at the top of her head.If you get stuck, let me know when I can.Yeah.I see.I'm sorry.I'm a little.Okay, somebody was talking about hypomania is the Pastoral gift.I see.Yeah, I guess the thing that I'm sort of thinking is your surprise to his comment hurt or you're saying you're not clear why it hurt a lot.Do you feel that?I did catch a little James's sort of quality there and asking you a question like that like I'm saying.Well.I mean not asAs I was telling you that telling you you weren't perceptive left or not reacting correctly or something like that.If you know in your head that you still a mix about being married to you or because of your depression that if you know those things that is bringing them up shouldn't hurt or something like that something like that.I'm sorry, so you muddy the waters because he thought you were upset because he answered the question in the way.He answered it upset you.And you're saying you're upset by asking it.Oh, I see falling that you ask him.Okay, I didn't get that.And your worry is that hearing this exchange between the two of you?I will either like catch contagious some of his particular attitude towards you in this way and I feel I will feel that about you as well or that I will take your side and say like I can't believe you said thatSomething like that.And either one.I think if I were to do either one of those things, I think I would start to be like reacting for you a little bit to the situation with him rather than like let you talk about it.I see so which in that case confirm horrible things you think?Already about yourself and yet there's a sense.I guess it's sort of feel like I was being sort of critical chance and that would be a cause of your wanted to take care of him.I don't think I'm very clear about that.It's not that I don't believe you is just that I don't I don't understand it like for the sake of teasing it out.So like that's ridiculous.That's totally unfair of him.Then I would feel like I was criticizing him or I would bet it would been like I was running him down.So I guess what I'm saying.I'm having trouble getting to them.I get the my criticism of him.That would be sort of devastating.We should stop.Is 90 out there, right?Oh my goodness.startyou start today.Monday goodThat's great.Brazilsounds like you feel excited andnot going toyou're not going to get what do you mean what?Shut down.I hear what you're saying that it would get shut down, but I don't know your sense of why.It's not a very bad thing at all.I think it's just sort of understanding what that what you started to say was because it's more real just as a different reason.and by thatthere's nothing complicated.And with her, do you feel that way or you saying like it gets split off somehow when you're taking a relationship seriously?Like you're valuing other parts of the relationship.As much if not more than the sexual part right now.Yeah, it's almost like not being as distracted.even by sexWhich can be seductive and alluring In the Heat of the Moment, but your mind is focused on.More on other parts of your own life right now.When did she lose?So so pretty recent.it's interesting becausethere's that there and then there's also a feeling of loneliness.Like how those go together.I mean in some ways you may be developing a greater capacity to be alone in a way.It used to be that you filled up the loan with people with sex.It's masturbation or a person or you know, all the holes were just getting plucked so that you felt less alone.It feels like now you're feeling the loneliness more and aware ofAnd thinking about the feeling.It but it's not so intolerable.You have to come outside as much and in fact, there may be some comfort and what you're feeling inside yourself by yourself.like getting your life together and then they'll be room relationship starting to feel likethis isn't where you land.I didn't hear it.I wonder what about that story something poignant about the story?Like when you connect that with wanting to reach people angry about that.And do something that just adjust the drive you feel people understand about themselves.make connectionsWell, they also start to sound like they don't deal is much like it's feeling like scattered like a little of this and then a little bit and then in the hole.There's actually a coherence what you're saying that we're always around this feeling of wanting to make contact emotional contact with other people that changes them whether it's psychology education culture.Is so often that you would say about where the critique would come in about.Why do I want to teach a bunch of undergrads?Even if you were a faculty member it wouldn't matter to most of them you wouldn't be able to make contact with most of them or just there to check.It off the box like part of what's resonate about that is then where you got to actually affect someone?That's why I imagine your money would be better invested.I mean a lot of people don't end up if this is what your about they could care less what your website looks like once they've met you and if they think you're helpful.Do you know what I mean?I do.and that LCD part being SSA MelodyAnd is it always the same Melody?or done it all evolve into something completely different and then that lastin the melody, what about the melody what comes to mind about it?Is it something you know?a song Your Song SongHow many notes what is in that phrase?And then you stop and go back.Yes.Playing I haven't seen it for a while.So, what do you think?Is it when you're nervous?the song A BeatOh, so it's not just private.As a kid, do you remember?The places you were describing with a friend walking down the street or with Cecilia.It sounds like it's joyful, its exuberant.is it always that is aboutis that the feeling always with the song or can you also be sad?It's a good feeling.You keep saying I don't know dismissively.So there's nothing more to know about it.There's so much more to know about it.There could be that not caring but you're also saying you're picking up on this on why the song Why is it only this?It's not just that you're singing any Happy song walking down the street.It's a particular song that gets repeated over and over and over again.What's the meaning of that song?Is it hard to stock when it's like that like if you said okay, stop doing that to yourself.Would it be hard to not do it?Or maybe you've never tried.Well, even if it's not a shit, like could you if you just said all right what happens if I try to not do it right now or think about something else?It sounds like being playful.the white hearted part theOut loud or you mean in your head?Orma DurantAnd it's insulting is it?Definitely not.Yeah.And yet it's a particular thing.I mean even as were saying they don't mean to be insulting.It's also interesting that it's a dumbass.I mean, it'sSo there is always aggression somewhere inside that kind of joke, right?Yeah, I keep thinking about spirituals for some reason and slavery involving music these horrible things become a way to cope.I know it doesn't have that flavor.It's not a Stark.And maybe, you know keeping it light-hearted or keeping it in sing-songy.It's better than it really really getting you into trouble.Might become a kind of container for all the feelings.It's interesting.It's like a secret quiet Rebellion that the person never been knows about.But I still get to have a voice inside of you.You've been so people-pleasing a polite and differential on the surface, right?I mean to an extreme in a way, dating to other people's needs and worries.There may be a way that even just that you're noticing us more.Maybe you're doing it more.Maybe there's something freeing about being able to actually let those words roll off your tongue a little more.That's about a free Nelson something.How are you?What's up?Have you done without the Klonopin?rightThe thing I don't get is that you're saying that she's screwing up and sort of not playing by the rules.She supposed to play by and get some how that's going to help her win becauseRight, so there's no consequences for her not being ready.Then you feel pretty helpless actually in like you can be beat this way and there's not much you can do about it.There's not a that's not exactly what you're saying, but it sounds like that's feels likeKnow what did it say?When did you send it?Oh, yes.Yes.I got it and it went over my head but I thought about it and I thought I haven't done anything on it.Tell me again what you need and I will do by Friday.How's that?By when do you need it?Are you sure?All right.I'll get it in by Friday or in the next couple of days.Yes, so that's Thursday.weather update, okayI don't think it will be hard for me to update it a little bit and soften some of what about is how hard a time you're having but still say you're not out of the woods essentially you're a better functioning and more able to work with suicide by the depression in a way that keeps you from.I don't know not.Schening something to that effect.Okay.Sorry about that.ritecheck Sia positedwill work out overall when you pay her because they're shortening it.What does Charlie mean?It sounds a little like you're kind of intimidated and overwhelmed and imagine that if you do something it won't make any difference.Anyway, if you'd like you're dealing with Jess or something.Although my impression is that once you actually Step Up you generally do quite well, the first part of the trial went pretty well, right and there are a lot of other things like that.I think with work when there's impending catastrophes and you figure out a way out of it or finesse it.Yeah, what happened with that by the way?Okay, just working with who?Is it that you also tend to feel pretty responsible for thinks it's weird in some ways you feel very responsible for things and another ways you don't but you do feel like you've messed up so many things that whenever there's a problem somebody's reasonably going to blame you.Because even if that thing isn't quite your fault, there's probably something else that is.Is there actually anything you could have done to about the wire?amazingSo it sounds like you were careful about the thing you could have been careful about which was how to handle that.But you had nothing to do with the wire being late, right?Bright apparently not.So it's in this area?Yep, right by the highway.Yeah, maybe that's what it is and the trial as well you feel like so if I try I'm going to fuck it up or the other person is so domineering or she's going to know more or the judge is going to side with her somehow or I won't follow through with what I need to anyway.So, what's the point?Actually usually do the things work, I think.I thought you bought the tickets all at once.Yes.if for youserviceHopefully in first grade you won't get into too much trouble.Good.Well good.Well, is it good that she wants you around, right?He was over Saturday night.That was cool.Is he getting a little old to run in the Parks or do you still like them?I was at the cool little break down the other day.They have a lot of birthday parties.They have a whole bunch of big inflatable slides and things like that.Right.You were telling me about that.Oh I can obstacle course.Why don't we stop for now?I think I ran a few more minutes late, but if we could do.those on Friday that would probably beHow are you?meaning likeWhat considerably?I get it.SpriteThis is when you were on the bus with her.Yeah, it was at the movie theater.Okay.rightrightI see it's too disturbing.yeah, likerightwell, there's a lot to understand but one of the things I I think I heard you say about therapy is that it makes you feel a lot of ways and you're describing it very sort of Expose and washing like I've beenkind of stay or wander into whatever party like, you know, and I know what you were talking about in whatever way that gives you crowding or intrusive or attitude out of your control what you did and I know there may be all the stuff.I think you should work on but that doesn't meanyou are for it orI see.Okay.Got you.Yeah, I got you.Yeah, I guess.hereYou are your own like this and then it becomes this.Or does it seem to be this?I think.and that adds to thejust a sort of control with what you're actually dealing with or a really a thing I want to say is look I know that it one level.This is clearly what you expect in some cases what you what you want or sort of?What you want?You're not I'm not saying that I'm unaware of that.I'm talking more.I'm referring more to like what can feel much better in the moment or what can make it to school that kind of thing if that makes sense.That would be doing him.brightI see.Yeah, yeah, I would imagine that if it's registered as much as such before now you would have said so.I did.Yeah, absolutely.This isn't coming across to me as something that you said.It's like knowing you had trouble saying so as something that was unclear was kind of in the way.That was in making you feel bad in the way that it would.Yeah, okay.Yeah.I see.Yeah, we can stop for now.Do you have any idea what you want to do or talk about some more next week and then try to make a decision?Sure.I see.Okay, I think I probably have the midday appointments during the rest of the week.Do you want to look at those now, or do you want to just go just meet Tuesday and go from there?Okay, let's do that.See you next Monday so thatAll right, then.I'll see you on Tuesday.How are you?Okay.Got to give you long enough to wake up.I see ya.That's good.That's probably good.attendEspecially when he knows that could or should know that he'd know that.alsonotice that you didn't start of describe.What happened.What were you saying?What was going on that really before?I guess on the way to the therapy session and that's fine.But I I guess what I wondered is whether you were concerned that.I imagine two things, but I didn't feel.It would just make you feel worse to explain it like it would make you feel worse about how much it bothered you.I don't know.I guess not knowing what happened has.I don't ya.You could feel it.And then we park you're looking for parking.And we end up in one of the spots.That had to have quarters instead of taking your credit card and we didn't have quarters.And then we had to move on move and and he was just grumpy with me about it.I don't remember what he said.I just remember him being grumpy with me.You know, I just he and I have sort of talked about this several times and he started made it clear when we talked about it that he's not upset with me.He's just pissed about the driving and the spills over and I sort of find it unacceptable that it spills over but I recognize that that's just something that people's emotions do sometimes and I don't know how much is reasonable to ask him to not indicate that he's frustrated anyway.Great.rightrightYeah.I mean not in any external way.I mean, I don't have crowded though anything obviously bad happened or any one said anything mean.Nothing like that.Yeah.bearsthere's I know this sort of I'm not quite sure.What do you do with this?You mentioned kind of feeling bruised after last night.You mentioned James getting under your skin this morning and you mentioned feeling like one big bruise.We talked about cutting last week and that was on your mind a lot.I think what I know.Yeah.Guess unwittingly.I read it reiterated a little bit of my x-ray vision.Sue and maybe this is making something out of nothing butComplicated my thought was a strict.I was shocked when you said it's like a superpower because maybe I'm saying something interpretive but you know.What it's like to be interpretive you've interpreted a lot of things I mean more.You know.Yeah.Yeah.Right, it's okay.I guess here's me.Yeah, go ahead.Yeah.Yeah, this is sort of it's like there's some kind of NBA going on where it's sort of I think the idea that what you're trying what you're saying or presenting is interpretable or that there's something that's already on the surface.There's just something about people getting under your skin or getting a little bit into you that seems to be getting reiterated and made and where maybe this is it actually seems to beI guess I imagined that maybe there is something a little bit defensive about framing it that way what I have in mind isyeah, likelike maybe it's kind of more out there already than you sing.Then you like to think that it is, you know, maybe like maybe James just pissing you off, right?You know what I mean?II know what you mean understand that.And that one is big and I never would have gone anywhere with it.But like it sort of makes it less like you should necessarily be in control of it, or you should expect yourself to be in control of it if we think about.It is like James getting under your skin or it's if I have a super super x-ray vision and then it's not like it's kind of out there already and what you're saying.Or that you know it in a way unconsciously maybe even wanting me to know or trying to communicate it.Sure.I am just about out.I see and I imagine thats'more in your own eyes and on your own behalf and say it's not mine.I imagine that since the failure is in your own eyes and on your own behalf rather than like as you feel it in mind in other words.I don't think you're imagining.I think you feel so much and as you're feeling like according to you, this is not how you're supposed to be.Okay.I see.Yeah, I think the way you're describing is actually feeling more connected to and reacted to people.That you would like to be or that then you like to be.Sure.I think it's also it also sort of an explanation.Anyway for what you're saying before about how you also want people to know.I think that it seems less obvious than you would the same like it's easier toAre both kinds of Shame related to how much people matter?I mean I guess like you knowyou know start of an intermediatesort of way like it just shouldn't make that much goddamn difference if James is being snippy if you know that he does thisand you know what the context is and you brought it up with him before like you just shouldn't matter so goddamn much in the morning in the moment and what he's saying so literally shouldn't want people to know much know so much people shouldn't be that important that you care that much to tell them somethingI don't want you to sit back.Of course if the right people matter a lot, but I guess I'm wondering if there's somewhere if there's somewhere another way.I can because I think you always feel a lot of Shame when you feel like you need people are not always but those two seem to go together.I see through the last few minutes.Do the last few minutes?hahamakes you feel both really ashamed and also really afraid that.Not even my knowing that.weyou know, it seems like that's really kind of.The main thing or one of the main things that you were shame and worried about me and how that would like drive me away.And the way you deal with that is to be like you shouldn't or you should know more about the doctor thing Mark no more of the doctor thing.Sometimes you feel like you don't like it's on you if you're not more in control of how your affected by someone you need to you need or you're not more in control that you tell them.rightThat's really terrible.Absolutely.I understand.and I guess somebody that running kind of unclear like historically it's not hard to imagine where I came from but in terms of your actualunclear why it's so bad to need Arturo or rely on someone how you imagine that causes them or us to leave.I mean history.historicallyin a general way it's not hard to imagine where it came from, but there must be some sort some way in your mind that that works in that part at least me is clear.Why we should stop.Come on Inn.Good.Thank you.spring break fromfrom collegeam I in college?I'm not sure.I understand.Your thinking has become the rule for me.I don't know what that means.I see you said that to him.How did how did he respond to your saying, you know you don't Inspire passion in me?I just I mean it seems like you had a very important conversation with him last night telling him you're actually not interested in marriage.May seem like a big thing.She kind of okay.Well next topic.Do you feel you're with him because you're afraid to be alone.I don't understand.He said that he had a priority to get married.So I'm not sure what you're referring to.Yeah, well open terms of impact on the two of you and just how you felt about it, too.Seems like he's making it clear that this is not what he wants this, you know the sort of going on kind of relationship.I see because so many other people as jobs are so easy and they work so few hours.I don't know what that means People magazine Mia.A post attorneys who don't do any work.People in business or Finance positions.I don't know.It doesn't seem like a very elite elitist comment.I mean you can easily make the argument I could do academics have so much more free time so much more flexible time than any other job.Did I see what sort of a demon sort of and idealization of Academia univ academics as Beneath The Fray other plebeians have time for emotions, but not academics.purposely losing sightWhat do you think that on purpose Port Isabel?Why not?What about it doesn't seem possible.Is your heart into what you're saying?right nowreally?You seem distracted and you're playing with like.If you're trying to sell something right now, I wouldn't believe the product.No need to apologize.I was just pointing out.It depends on well, too revealing means you're revealing more than you want to so.You feel anxious about your comment to him.Well, he certainly awakens this maybe there's a chance for something else.Maybe it's an antidote to your feelings that no one else could love you.He comes into the picture and you think well, maybe.But in your relationship with David, you're really coasting.You're not you're not using your driving controls.You're not going in forward reverse breaking your just coasting.If it's not on the pedal your foot on the brake, you're just coasting.That's very true.But he's not my patient.I care about his well-being in a general sense, butIs psychological growth and development is not my part of my job.I agree with your assessment, but my guess is also that you want something different than this not necessarily even different than him maybe different from him, but certainly different from the relationship you have right now.And this might be aside from the commitment.Peace.This might be exactly what he wants.This kind of relationship.I don't know people can be very ambitious, but also be deeply connected and emotionally invested in the people around them.You see these things as opposites.Will you were saying before well, he's in Academia.So maybe he just doesn't have time.Yes, you're way too needy.That's wishful thinking.Give us a high-value fun things.I don't know you could ask him.Like an answer and why he doesn't like fun things.That was the most emotion I saw it from you today.What you just said, I'm sick of this.I don't know.Frustration is more emotion than I saw from you today so far.Say not in general.today not in generalWhat I what I said earlier about like I'm not buying this product.I do feel you go into these times where you're trying to sell yourself and me on some life philosophy.And about what you should be able to do without I don't think you're buying you're not a convincing spokesman because you don't buy it either.You're just sort of giving lip service.Well and alone is relative because you have a lot of people in your life.You're not sure.I was going to say I don't know the word but you certainly have lots of groups.Yeah in your life and you're connected tomaybe you don't feel like you have a lot of people you're connected to you one-on-one, but I'm not sure that's afind when you say that's fun.She said you pie.Maybe it'll have to break down to be nurtured like that.Well, maybe that's what makes you feel needy because you feel like that's the only way to sort of generate that kind of connection.I kind of people feel nurtured without the sense of desperation or urgency.Getting a piece of pie everyday.We do need to stop for today.I will see you on Wednesday.TroyWe CareHi, how are you doing?No.Oh, it's a tissues the tissues with Vicks in them.I don't like them.I think I have some others.Yeah, but that assumes that the child will develop into an independent adults.with your motherWhat is the mechanism in which by what she'll change?Well, why do you assume that the way your mother is now won't be the way she'll be in the future.It depends on the person.And yes, and because you're growing and changing and reflecting on your life and thinking about you know, how you want to grow that you know, your mom won't because you see that she that the two of you as so low tide.If it were true that everybody's already gotten so, you know gone to where they wanted.You would be my only patient.Well, don't you think people come to therapy?Because they want to be something more than a different than they are now oils with people come.AliceWhat how do you describe as childish?What do you think you was trying to say to you?I mean, that's why I'm asking because I don't know what you're trying to say to you.Yeah, I do understand where he was going with that.Do you know what it means?To the website that you volunteered for.Why did you volunteer?well, then you feel taken advantage ofOh, how did I'm infuriated in them with them translate to in 200 I'll work for you for free.Yeah, I'm trying to understand that link.Usually people you feel wronged by an angry with you.Don't then ask volunteer to help.You make them feel guilty.What do monsters have kindness?And there was originally a piece of writing that you submitted right?So they're supposed to reconsider your writing cuz you're helping them out.It seems like apples and oranges.Then you have this feel bad or wonder whether they're publishing your peace based on the Merit versus guilt.How could you ever know?So you would like you're hoping to put them in a position where they don't feel they have a choice.well less obituariesSo if you feel obligated to someone then you have less of a choice by definition.Have you?Do you see them as kind?How do you see them?Do you see them as less monster than you did before?Do you think you offered your help because you're hoping to be included by those who excluded you?What do you like about it?Play flogging to those who exclude you you're just perpetuating the narrative.will be wanting by seek and approval from those who have already disapproved of you that's just perpetuating The Narrative it's not changingI'm not suggesting what you should or shouldn't do I'm just jesting what will your behavior and thoughts meanHow did it feel?I don't agree with you though.I mean, you know more about the writing world, but I think that in your current experience speak so many Americans it's a land of immigrants.Why do you say that?I don't know.It seems like Americans are very interested in the Immigrant experience.And if you look up percentages, I mean part of it is probably a percentage the number of people who submit you are from the US or born in the US vs. Asian Americans.I'm sure the percentage is pretty low may be represented in the publishing versus, you know in terms of the initial population.I guess maybe the larger point being that there are ways to see got the narrative.I mean in a way talking or taking on his magazine or this what magazine is like?Yeah.I mean it's seeking out the narrative secant validation in The Narrative of being excluded or being wrong and the only Power you feel has to make the other people feel a change you that's the only way in which you feel empowered.Feels like it's not a Perfect Analogy, but you're sort of switching roles with your your started becoming your mother's roll dice a b the magazine soda lying to someone feel obligated to you to give you a second chance to feel like they might owe you something if it's only sort of take your you know, what your Notch up your peace a little bit about other people because they think not only do they know you but you help them you given them three times.No, you're making someone feel obligated to you.Yeah, like her handing you over the bell for the rent.How can you cast me out so quickly you owe me.No, I'm stirring it is I think it's really healthy.I think we should continue helping you.What kind of question is that?Do you want to know that about yourself?No.Ever do that.Well, it sounds like what you're saying is that you're anxious those questions and part come out of anxiety.On this case being sick.Well, it's very limiting and it makes me feel terrible.This whole scenario.I mean, it sounds like you feel miserable with this volunteering.Is that something that brings you joy and pleasure or makes you feel good about yourself.I think we need to stop for today.I will see you on Monday.Did you call them?We'll figure it out.I know it's really hard.Thank you for doing that.Okay.Take care.Hi.Good.is that aYeah.Yeah.Yeah.I imagine it matters to you.You said cool.drinking water from the topThey were responsible.Yeah.Yeah, they can look after protect you.And then here, you know, I can't really look after I text you from any of these things that happen when you're talking about that.Who wrote it?That was pretty evil kind of actually.There's a famous quote from the 60s early 70s who said about analysis that like it's the job of people sort of stand there pain, which was in direct opposition to what the rest of the medical profession was doing.I think what a demonstrate about the can opener.Well a bunch of things.The first one is very solid.I mean, especially in that context.I mean, it's not just a metaphor about the context.He's going to a guy.Which is something about his sort of like.And also feels like me.I can also be like me.I see.I think there's quite a lot in that in the other thing that makes me think of it is your scars.No, my impression is that what's going on is what we are reenacting or image for a little bit and then I'm saying things I feel a little like uniburners, you know.And you feel not protected or safe but anxious and kind of cut into in some way.Answers to have a feel of when we are talking a while ago like them or contraction and yet I think you were stepping back and Away saying that's not what's going on.But I think in terms of how it feels to me, it's kind of like that.I think part of what you're saying is that all this feels the same the damage that you're describing including the Sun including the moldings winning the other things from when you were small and they're cutting herself and talking about it.
